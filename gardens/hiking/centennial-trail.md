This is a personal journal of my hikes along the South Dakota [Centennial Trail](https://www.blackhillsbadlands.com/centennial-trail-0), but it may also serve as a growing resource for the trail, especially GPS coordinates.

## Episode #1 - Just Getting Started

Amie, Graham and Royal drove me to the start of my first leg of the Centennial Trail and went a little ways down the path. We said our goodbyes (the boys stayed for a while to splash in the creek) and I headed for where I estimated I would run into the official trail, near Sheridan Lake.

I discovered the first Centennial Trail blazon just after passing Sheridan Lake. My estimate was correct! I marched up the ravine and came to a three-way intersection, where I made a crucial mistake.

It turns out that the Centennial Trail is _sometimes_ marked from both north and south directions. This wouldn't be a huge problem except that a horse bypass near Sheridan Lake has the same markings as the core trail except for the addition a picture of a horse, causing the trail to form a circle. What?! I did not realize the horse picture mattered and walked the wrong way **all the way back to where I started**. I lost nearly two hours hiking back down to where I started, then hiking right back up.

Though I began with a two-hour delay, a concrete walking tunnel supplied a cool place to cook lunch and dry out my socks.

There was another benefit to eating lunch near the tunnel; after a half-hour the trail merges with an ATV track with a mild uphill grade and no shade. I was grateful when to finally make it back into the trees an hour later.

When I stopped a little past 1:00 I tried to give up the hike and go home. I was hot from climbing without shade and dreading what was coming next - the Bald Hills. Sounds hot, doesn't it? I pulled out my map and found a nearby road and messaged Amie to pick me up there. But I had no cell reception and the message never sent. Guess I'm pressing on.

After winding through trees and meadows for a while I passed a suprisingly clean animal drinking trough. I kept climbing for a little while and rested below a tree at 2:00. I realized that my water was low, so I put everything down and walked back to the water trough for a refill. On this trip I didn't need it, but it's not wise to hike without water for any distance.

My dread of the Bald Hills was unfounded. There's a refreshingly strong breeze that sweeps over the hills which makes it comfortable as walking in shade. And the view is stunning.

I managed cell reception at the top of one of the hills and called Amie. I had given her two pickup locations - Pactola Resevoir if everything went according to plan and Brush Creek Trailhead if it didn't. I let her know I'd meet her at Brush Creek.

I'd been careful to stop regularly to swap out wool socks and had kept my blister count small, but my time was running short to meet Amie at Brush Creek by 4:00. So I did pressed through with fewer stops and arrived a few minutes before.

I snapped photos of most of the trail blazons from which I assembled a highly accurate GPS map of the trail. As I conquer more of the trail I'll pull together a single cohesive file, but for now you can download the KML file and import it to Google Earth to take a tour of my trip!
