The American Church is in the midst of a slow-burning crisis. Because I love the Body and long for its renewal, and because I'm {{< backref src="/plants/identity/the-apostolic-gift" name="apostolically gifted" >}}, I spend many hours agonizing over Her health and future. Broadly, this garden is where I plant thoughts related to the renovation of the Church of the United States.

I can't think of anything better for the revival of the Church of the United States than the {{< backref src="/plants/faith/launch-a-dmm" name="ignition of disciple-making movements" >}}. We've become hyper-focused on expanding brick-and-mortar churches, but {{< backref src="/stones/peyton-jones/christ-never-commanded-his-disciples-to-plant-churches" >}}. Let's get back to a focus on disciples themselves, and hold the models for gathering, instruction and worship loosely.

## Disciples Who Share Jesus

Let's examine how we teach disciples to share the good news about Jesus. Introducing others to Jesus is crucial to the expansion of the Kingdom in our midst, and one of the most exhilarating and terrifying practices of the Body corporate.

The most common reaction to the word "evangelism" is discomfort. This can range from mild shame that we're not doing enough to an allergic reaction at the idea of foisting our views on others. Generally, it's not a word that elicits excitement, wonder, or joy. Could it be that our understanding of the practice is off and, perhaps, we could reduce our own and our disciple's discomfort and grow our joy?

A return to making disciples who make disciples corrects many misunderstandings, for {{< backref src="/plants/faith/evangelism-is-making-disciples" >}}. People rarely follow Jesus on a whim, and almost never by themselves. Long-lasting {{< backref src="/plants/faith/allegiance-to-jesus-is-communal" >}}, while {{< backref src="/plants/faith/lone-converts-are-a-liability" >}}. If we love our disciples, we must remember that {{< backref src="/plants/faith/becoming-a-christian-is-a-process" >}} and not leave them to figure it out on their own with hit-and-run tactics. We must review our {{< backref src="/plants/faith/when-are-they-converted" name="theology of conversion" >}}.

Alan Hirsch states that {{< backref src="/stones/alan-hirsch/discipleship-done-biblically-is-always-in-community" >}}. For sharing Jesus, that means {{< backref src="/plants/faith/evangelism-is-a-team-sport" >}}. We're on the hunt to {{< backref src="/plants/faith/find-the-peaceful-people" >}} together, not to {{< backref src="/plants/faith/evangelism-is-not-a-winners-game" name="win souls" >}}. That's why together we {{< backref src="/plants/faith/look-everywhere-for-the-spiritually-open" >}}.

Our discomfort isn't always because we're doing it alone, however. We also don't know what to say. Many of us have discovered that gospel synopses produce more confusion than conversion in our climate, because {{< backref src="/plants/faith/the-good-news-begins-with-the-back-story" >}} but no one knows that story anymore. That's assuming we even know {{< backref src="/plants/faith/what-is-the-gospel" >}}. Others don't share because they feel empty or incomplete, not knowing that {{< backref src="/plants/faith/we-give-more-than-we-have" >}}.

We might liken sharing the good news about Jesus as an invitation to trust. Therefore, any conversation about evangelism ought to consider how it is that people {{< backref src="/gardens/faith/what-i-have-learned-about-trust" name="learn to trust" >}}. Jessie Cruikshank's work on the {{< backref src="/plants/faith/stages-of-faith-development" >}} is very helpful.

There are ways we could communicate good news that would excel the business and education domains. More thinking to do, but parable was Jesus' primary mode of communication. See {{< backref src="/plants/writing/parable-and-poetry-hit-harder-than-prose" >}} and {{< backref src="/plants/writing/short-stories-are-modern-parables">}}.

## Disciples Who Understand the Bible

For all the good that's come from preaching, there's a dearth of disciples who read, understand and apply the Bible for themselves. Our leaders may have developed the skills to read, understand, and apply, but these skills aren't making it to their disciples. Do any of them hold a view that {{< backref src="/plants/faith/the-bible-is-for-wisdom-and-pleasure" >}}?

Sometimes its errors in teaching. For all our desire to see people change because of our conviction that {{< backref src="/plants/faith/to-listen-and-obey-jesus-word-brings-life" >}}, dolling out applications is ineffective because {{< backref src="/plants/faith/direct-application-hinders-discovery" >}}. At other times teachers are too convinced of their own interpretation and too critical of other's, often cloaked in a fear of heresy, forgetting that {{< backref src="/plants/faith/biblical-interpretation-is-cyclical" >}}. There are interpretive dangers, such as how {{< backref src="/plants/faith/interpretive-replacements-sometimes-erase-context" >}} or when {{< backref src="/plants/faith/quotes-without-context-invite-misunderstanding" >}}, but how will disciples learn to interpret well without practicing it with us?

I wonder if there's an advantage for leaders to maintain a view of the Bible as a mystical book. Instead of demystifying and humanizing the collection, leaders often propagate incomplete {{< backref src="/plants/faith/ways-to-define-the-bible" >}}. Disciples learn to treat certain parts as more special than others, especiall they epistles. But {{< backref src="/plants/faith/epistles-are-real-correspondence" >}}, not summaries of the whole.

Our greatest successes with training disciples to read, understand and apply the Bible (in community) is through Discovery Bible Study (DBS). Here are a few {{< backref src="/plants/faith/discovery-stories" >}} that highlight the difference.

## Disciples Who Look More Like Jesus Every Week

Encountering Jesus in the Bible is crucial to discipleship into his likeness, which is why reading the Bible in community is a non-negotiable. A review of Jesus' lifestyle does suggest a number of spiritual exercises which Christians throughout the centuries have codified. While spiritual disciplines should be descriptive, not prescriptive, they can help Christians in their obedience to Jesus. I recommend, however, that no practice be embraced which cannot be taught through public example.

- {{< backref src="/stones/henri-nouwen/the-great-secret-of-the-spiritual-life-is-that-you-already-know-the-little-steps" >}}

### Solitude

I enjoy being alone. Not everyone does. Jesus spent many mornings alone in the wilderness with his Father. {{< backref src="/plants/faith/from-solitude-through-surrender-to-compassion" name="The practice of solitude built compassion for others" >}}. It also creates {{< backref src="/plants/faith/freedom-from-comparison-produces-humility" name="an environment free of comparision" >}}, which produces humility because {{< backref src="/stones/henri-nouwen/solitude-exposes-our-false-selves" >}}.

The desert fathers and mothers are often cited as examples of this practice, but I think it's likely that we're losing sight of their community. They may have spent a lot of time alone, but they also had disciples. From whence did their disciples learn to navigate the dangers and embrace the riches of solitude? Monasteries provide the best modern-day examples of how to practice solitude with disciples.

### Prayer

Jesus prayed. He taught his disciples to pray. And we must teach our disciples to pray also.

There are as many ways to pray as there are people. Prayer stretches into the past, the present and the future because {{< backref src="/plants/faith/prayer-transcends-spacetime" >}}. Let us learn from our mentors and teach by example prayer to our disciples.

### Sabbath

It's been my experience that most Christians have lost sight of Sabbath. We don't realize anymore that {{< backref src="/plants/faith/sabbath-is-a-social-imperative" >}}. We don't attempt to {{< backref src="/plants/faith/keep-the-sabbath-remix" name="keep the Sabbath" >}} in our own context. And what a shame, for Sabbath is made to be shared; it's the perfect disciple-making space! TODO: write more about Sabbath as disciple-making focus-time.

### Generosity

## Disciples Who Exercise Their Gifts

We look to Jesus as the ultimate example, because {{< backref src="/plants/faith/jesus-fulfills-the-roles-and-gifts" >}}. And we are to follow him, but we're not all equally gifted in every area of the five-fold ministry (APEST for short).

{{< backref src="/plants/identity/the-apostolic-gift" >}} is one of my stronger gifts. This makes me uncomfortable, but it must be said. There's some overlap with the concept of a polymath identity and the apostolic gift, so {{< backref src="/plants/identity/embracing-my-polymath-identity" >}} may also be related to embracing the apostolic gift. It's also related to entrepreneurship, for {{< backref src="/plants/faith/apostles-and-entrepreneurs-share-characteristics" >}}.

It's interesting to note that {{< backref src="/plants/faith/apostolic-gifts-focus-on-one-mission-in-two-directions" >}}. We can't deny that both Paul and Peter were apostles of equal standing, but their calling and lifestyle differed in significant ways.

A few thoughts worth developing further.

1. The effect outsourcing apostolic gifting to parachurch orgs has on the local body. Loses partnership outside the building. Loses voice from the fringes. Loses the capacity to find, assess and disciple more apostles.

2. Clarify Kingdom Manifesto as the bleeding edge of the Body. Its not needed for the core to match (though it may benefit), but it is a coherent vision for the edges.

3. Think more about Internet-supported distance discipleship. After all these years, the people most on my heart are still those who I've sent/left. Maybe I'm not required to make a lot of friends in my local church to belong.

4. Note that Paul never sent a recorded epistle to Antioch. His heart was where he'd been invested, not his local church community.

## Disciples Who Gather

My magnum opus, the {{< backref src="/plants/faith/kingdom-manifesto" >}} is my best effort to describe the bleeding edge between the established Church and the frontier in language and categories both helpful to the former and relevant to the latter.
