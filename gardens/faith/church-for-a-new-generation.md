The American Church is in the midst of a slow-burning crisis. Because I love the Body and long for its renewal, and because I'm {{< backref src="/plants/identity/the-apostolic-gift" name="apostolically gifted" >}}, I spend many hours agonizing over Her health and future.

## Evangelism

Introducing others to Jesus is crucial to the expansion of the Kingdom in our midst. It's also the most exhilarating and terrifying practices of the Body. This garden is an exploration into the subject of Evangelism, but also the many related brambles that trip people up when they hear the word.

The most common reaction to the word "evangelism" is discomfort. This can range from the mild discomfort of shame that you're not doing enough of it to an allergic reaction that anyone would foist their views on another. Generally, it's not a word that elicits excitement, wonder, or joy. Come with me through a few paradigm shifts and see if, perhaps, we can reduce your discomfort and grow your joy.

## Identity

- There's something here, but I haven't reviewed it yet: {{< backref src="a-stunted-view-of-god-limits-imitation" >}}

## Structure

My magnum opus, the {{< backref src="/plants/faith/kingdom-manifesto" >}} is my best effort to describe the edge between the established Church and the frontier in language and categories both helpful to the former and relevant to the latter.

- {{< backref src="/plants/business/spider-followers-need-an-extra-push" >}}

## Growth

- I can't think of anything better than to {{< backref src="/plants/faith/launch-a-dmm" >}}.
- We're focused on starting churches, but {{< backref src="/stones/peyton-jones/christ-never-commanded-his-disciples-to-plant-churches" >}}.

## Communication

There are ways we could communicate information that would excel the business and education domains. More thinking to do, but parable was Jesus' primary mode of communication. See {{< backref src="/plants/writing/parable-and-poetry-hit-harder-than-prose" >}} and {{< backref src="/plants/writing/short-stories-are-modern-parables">}}.

## Five-Fold Gifts

{{< backref src="/plants/identity/the-apostolic-gift" >}} is one of my stronger gifts. This makes me uncomfortable, but it must be said. There's some overlap with the concept of a polymath identity and the apostolic gift, so {{< backref src="/plants/identity/embracing-my-polymath-identity" >}} may also be related to embracing the apostolic gift. It's also related to entrepreneurship, for {{< backref src="/plants/faith/apostles-and-entrepreneurs-share-characteristics" >}}.

It's interesting to note that {{< backref src="/plants/faith/apostolic-gifts-focus-on-one-mission-in-two-directions" >}}. We can't deny that both Paul and Peter were apostles of equal standing, but their calling and lifestyle differed in significant ways.

A few thoughts worth developing further.

1. The effect outsourcing apostolic gifting to parachurch orgs has on the local body. Loses partnership outside the building. Loses voice from the fringes. Loses the capacity to find, assess and disciple more apostles.

2. Clarify Kingdom Manifesto as the bleeding edge of the Body. Its not needed for the core to match (though it may benefit), but it is a coherent vision for the edges.

3. Think more about Internet-supported distance discipleship. After all these years, the people most on my heart are still those who I've sent/left. Maybe I'm not required to make a lot of friends in my local church to belong.

4. Note that Paul never sent a recorded epistle to Antioch. His heart was where he'd been invested, not his local church community.
