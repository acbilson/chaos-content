This is a {{< acronym MOC "Map Of Content" >}} for the subject of apostolic gifting and work. It's my best attempt to understand the gift in light of my own expression of it and the examples I find in the Bible.

- This is one of my stronger gifts. See {{< backref src="/plants/identity/the-apostolic-gift" >}}
- It's related to being a polymath (at least in my case). See {{< backref src="/plants/identity/embracing-my-polymath-identity" >}}
