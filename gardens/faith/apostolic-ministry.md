Like a garden full of tulips and roses, this garden blends what I'm learning about the apostolic gift with what I'm discovering about my own identity.

{{< backref src="/plants/identity/the-apostolic-gift" >}} is one of my stronger gifts. This makes me uncomfortable, but it must be said. There's some overlap with the concept of a polymath identity and the apostolic gift, so {{< backref src="/plants/identity/embracing-my-polymath-identity" >}} may also be related to embracing the apostolic gift. It's also related to entrepreneurship, for {{< backref src="/plants/faith/apostles-and-entrepreneurs-share-characteristics" >}}.

It's interesting to note that {{< backref src="/plants/faith/apostolic-gifts-focus-on-one-mission-in-two-directions" >}}. We can't deny that both Paul and Peter were apostles of equal standing, but their calling and lifestyle differed in significant ways.

A few thoughts worth developing further.

1. The effect outsourcing apostolic gifting to parachurch orgs has on the local body. Loses partnership outside the building. Loses voice from the fringes. Loses the capacity to find, assess and disciple more apostles.

2. Clarify Kingdom Manifesto as the bleeding edge of the Body. Its not needed for the core to match (though it may benefit), but it is a coherent vision for the edges.

3. Think more about Internet-supported distance discipleship. After all these years, the people most on my heart are still those who I've sent/left. Maybe I'm not required to make a lot of friends in my local church to belong.

4. Note that Paul never sent a recorded epistle to Antioch. His heart was where he'd been invested, not his local church community.
