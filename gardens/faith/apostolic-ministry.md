Like a garden full of tulips and roses, this garden blends what I'm learning about the apostolic gift with what I'm discovering about my own identity.

{{< backref src="/plants/identity/the-apostolic-gift" >}} is one of my stronger gifts. This makes me uncomfortable, but it must be said. There's some overlap with the concept of a polymath identity and the apostolic gift, so {{< backref src="/plants/identity/embracing-my-polymath-identity" >}} may also be related to embracing the apostolic gift. It's also related to entrepreneurship, for {{< backref src="/plants/faith/apostles-and-entrepreneurs-share-characteristics" >}}.

It's interesting to note that {{< backref src="/plants/faith/apostolic-gifts-focus-on-one-mission-in-two-directions" >}}. We can't deny that both Paul and Peter were apostles of equal standing, but their calling and lifestyle differed in significant ways.
