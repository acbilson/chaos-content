This is an experiment to try a new organizational form for motivation and collaboration. I'll call it thesis design.

Thesis design begins with a thesis question, then one or more thesis statements will be developed in answer.
{{< /notice >}}

## What conflict resolution steps can be integrated into a childâ€™s habits in early childhood?

Where do I go to find the latest research on early childhood development?

#### Working Bibliography

- Crucial Conversations
- Erik Erikson's Stages of Childhood Development

## How do childhood education approaches shape children? What characteristics differ between a public-school-educated child vs. a home-school-educated child?

People who may have insight:

### Home School
- Val Whitney

### Public School
- Tom Vallette for Ty

### Private School

## What effect would teaching phonetic reading to children before Kindergarten have on their long-term reading comprehension?
