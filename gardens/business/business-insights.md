This is a curated garden of business insights. Like an English Walled Garden, I have spaced parts of the garden to peruse independently, so might find the same insight planted in multiple sections.

## Reflections (TODO: make a separate thing)

> This is how we know what love is: Jesus Christ laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers and sisters. If anyone has material possessions and sees a brother or sister in need but has no pity on them, how can the love of God be in that person? Dear children, let us not love with words or speech but with actions and in truth. - 1 John 3:16-18

One verse earlier, John reminds us how Jesus' compares anger with murder (NIV, Matthew 5:21). John points us to Cain - a man who envied his brother and in hatred killed him - to illustrate what love is not and explain why the world treats us poorly. When he turns to explain what love truly is, he points us to the sacrificial life of Jesus Christ. To my surprise, his second example after Jesus describes a person who feels compassion for a fellow believer in material need and gives some of his own possessions in response. He might have used any other example; perhaps a person who rescues someone from a burning building, or parents who adopt a child.

This passage applies to business because business is a means to gain possessions and an avenue by which we show compassion by giving our possessions away. The principle at heart - that love acts - may be expressed in the business world with generosity towards others' needs. Whether love be expressed by direct donation, care of the neighborhood, fair wages and leave policies for employees, or a combination of all, any business person with true love for others will show his love in deeds done.

> "There once was a king who had servants who had borrowed money from the royal treasury. He decided to settle accounts with each of them. As he began the process, it came to his attention that one of his servants owed him one billion dollars. So he summoned the servant before him and said to him, 'Pay me what you owe me.' When his servant was unable to repay his debt, the king ordered that he be sold as a slave along with his wife and children and every possession they owned as payment toward his debt. The servant threw himself facedown at his master's feet and begged for mercy. 'Please be patient with me. Just give me more time and I will repay you all that I owe.' Upon hearing his pleas, the king had compassion on his servant, and released him, and forgave his entire debt.

> "No sooner had the servant left when he met one of his fellow servants, who owed him twenty thousand dollars. He seized him by the throat and began to choke him, saying, 'You'd better pay me right now everything you owe me!' His fellow servant threw himself facedown at his feet and begged, 'Please be patient with me. If you'll just give me time, I will repay you all that is owed.' 30 But the one who had his debt forgiven stubbornly refused to forgive what was owed him. He had his fellow servant thrown into prison and demanded he remain there until he repaid the debt in full.

> "When his associates saw what was going on, they were outraged and went to the king and told him the whole story. The king said to him, 'You scoundrel! Is this the way you respond to my mercy? Because you begged me, I forgave you the massive debt that you owed me. Why didn't you show the same mercy to your fellow servant that I showed to you?' In a fury of anger, the king turned him over to the prison guards to be tortured until all his debt was repaid. In this same way, my heavenly Father will deal with any of you if you do not release forgiveness from your heart toward your fellow believer (_TPT_, Matthew 18:21-35)."

This illustration of God's kingdom comes in response to Peter's question about forgiveness. Peter asks in essence, "What's the limit to the number of times I must forgive my brother when he does me wrong?" Jesus responds that no limit exists, and he tells this parable to make his point.

The story does not address Peter's question directly, for the question of repeat wrongs is not explicitly raised in the parable. Perhaps one could infer it from the sizable debts which may not have been incurred all at once, but Jesus' emphasis seems to reside elsewhere. Instead of recurring debts, Jesus focuses his attention on the heart condition of a debtor who would not extend forgiveness to others but would accept forgiveness himself. The absurdity of the debtor's action is heightened by the unfathomable difference in debts: several lifetime's wages against three month's. Lest the reader mistake the parable, Jesus explains it directly - anyone who has received forgiveness by the Father and fails to forgive his brother is acting exactly like this absurd debtor. The question of times forgiven is rendered pointless by the story, for the meager debts incurred between brothers, whether by many infractions or one, will always be absurd against the immense debt incurred before God.

Surely any entrepreneur who reads this story will cringe and say, "If I operated my business the way the king operates his kingdom, I'd be broke before the week was out!" The injunction to the entrepreneur remains, that she must forgive those who sincerely ask for mercy as many times as they ask. This story never requires her to continually entrust the same debts to the one forgiven, however. While there are occasions that could arise in which total forgiveness would end the operation of the business, the entrepreneur is charged by Jesus to remember the great debt owed to God and to act accordingly. Among that debt is all that she has owned, owns, or ever will own, and justice is in God's hand. In fact, wise management of her business means she will not trust business-crippling sums to those who aren't trustworthy. So, while a misjudgment of character could cripple her business - which is true regardless of how she treats the debt incurred - this is the response of all who trust in God's forgiveness from the heart.
