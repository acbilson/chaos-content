# Site Updates

I'm slowly adding hundreds of business insights from my MBA to my site's notes. Getting them there is step one, then I want to begin mapping them together into a cohesive network for easy reference and thinking.

It's not going to happen right away, but someday I want to migrate the stories I've written in my ship's log into full stories under posts. That'll make them easier to find again. It's part of ongoing thoughts I have about the way my log operates. Today it's everything from day one, but it could be paginated by year, month, etc. Or it could be wiped fresh and the best moved. IDK.
