Here's a list of other independent blog writers that I follow and from whom I draw inspiration.

[Rachel by the Bay](http://rachelbythebay.com/) - She inspires me to keep writing and allow my opinions into my work.

[Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/) - He inspires me to write about more than technology, and to think of my writing as a resource for myself first.

[Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) - A lovely web page from an artistic programmer with a knack for explaining technical concepts.

[Michael Descy](https://mjdescy.me/) - The original encouragement to write a blog. Never met the man, but thanks for putting your thoughts up for the public!

[Dan Moore](https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/) - Dan's post encouraging developers to [try contracting](https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2018/11/12/try-contracting/) helped me maintain steam as a technology consultant.

[Max B&ouml;ck](https://mxb.dev/blog/) - Max's blog has a litany of resources to make one's personal website beautiful and interconnected. One of the first blogs I read that piqued my interest in the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/).

[Madison Taskett](https://www.madisontaskett.com/) - I've had a blast reading Madison's heartfelt and personal posts. Few writers express themselves on the web so openly that I regularly consider reaching out to them to say "thank you."
