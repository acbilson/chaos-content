Here's a list of other independent blog writers that I follow and from whom I draw inspiration.

{{< outref "http://rachelbythebay.com/" "Rachel by the Bay" >}} - She inspires me to keep writing and allow my opinions into my work.

{{< outref "https://www.hanselman.com/" "Scott Hanselman" >}} - He inspires me to write about more than technology, and to think of my writing as a resource for myself first.

{{< outref "https://jvns.ca/" "Julia Evans" >}} - A lovely web page from an artistic programmer with a knack for explaining technical concepts.

{{< outref "https://mjdescy.me/" "Michael Descy" >}} - The original encouragement to write a blog. Never met the man, but thanks for putting your thoughts up for the public!

{{< outref "https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/" "Dan Moore" >}} - Dan's post encouraging developers to {{< outref "https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2018/11/12/try-contracting/" "try contracting" >}} helped me maintain steam as a technology consultant. Buy his book on the {{< outref "https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484260739" "Apress website" >}}.

{{< outref "https://mxb.dev/blog/" "Max Böck" >}} - Max's blog has a litany of resources to make one's personal website beautiful and interconnected. One of the first blogs I read that piqued my interest in the {{< outref "https://indieweb.org/" "IndieWeb" >}}.

{{< outref "https://www.madisontaskett.com/" "Madison Taskett" >}} - I've had a blast reading Madison's heartfelt and personal posts. Few writers express themselves on the web so openly that I regularly consider reaching out to them to say "thank you."

{{< outref "https://victoria.dev/" "Victoria Drake" >}} - Her site is gorgeous, and her writing has the right balance between concise and simple. All the little tidbits, like the SQL statement for her related posts section, make it one of my favorite sites to visit.

{{< outref "https://macwright.com/" "Tom MacWright" >}} - Tom's site is minimalist, which is perfect considering the huge amount of content. I enjoy reading his posts because of his eclectic depth.

{{< outref "https://werd.io/" "Ben Werdmüller" >}} - Like Tom, Ben has eclectic depth. I suppose it's because they both write about the direction of the Internet, politics, and their personal lives from time-to-time.

{{< outref "http://interconnected.org/home/" "Matt Webb" >}} - I so enjoy reading Matt's original and sci-fi-inspired thoughts. He's inspired me to include more theory in my writing and not only accounts of facts and learnings.

{{< outref "http://www.aspeckledtrout.com/" "Kathy Fisher" >}} - Kathy most recently writes about a devastating trauma with such grace and honesty that it brings me to tears, but I've found you can pick any article from her archive and find a gem.

{{< outref "https://simonwillison.net/" "Simon Willison" >}} - Simon is a prolific technical writer. His work, particularly his investment in {{< outref "https://docs.datasette.io/en/stable/" "datasette" >}}, was my first introduction to the world of data journalism.

{{< outref "https://maggieappleton.com/garden" "Maggie Appleton" >}} - Maggie's digital garden is a visual wonderland full of surprises. From her epistemic gardening language to her intricate images and use of color, it's as enjoyable to peruse as a physical garden.

{{< outref "https://notes.andymatuschak.org" "Andy Matuschak" >}} - I find myself returning often to Andy's interlinked note system. His mature writing on digital notes and his custom navigation make a persuasive case to adopt his thinking approach.

{{< outref "https://joschuasgarden.com" "Joschua Glau" >}} - Joschua keeps a digital garden with novel ideas around note taking and Bible study.

{{< outref "https://winnielim.org/curated/" "Winnie Lim" >}} - Winnie's curated articles are beautifully crafted and thought-provoking.

{{< outref "https://salman.io/blog/" "Salman Ansari" >}} - Salman is a fellow polymath with a bent towards business innovation and self-expression.

{{< outref "https://busterbenson.com" "Buster Benson" >}} - Buster doesn't keep a website so much as a place to link public documents, but his writing is highly refined and fascinating to read.

{{< outref "https://brendanschlagel.com" "Brendan Schlagel" >}} - Brendan has several thoughtful posts about the subject of writing on the web.

{{< outref "https://barnesworthburning.net" "Barns Worth Burning" >}} - I honestly don't know what to make of this site, but I _love_ the way it operates. Magical.

{{< outref "https://laurakalbag.com/" "Laura Kalbag" >}} - I haven't spent a lot of time on her personal site (yet), but Laura's work for the {{< outref "https://small-tech.org/" "Small Technology Foundation" >}} has definitely influenced me.
