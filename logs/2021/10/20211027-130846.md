I'm launching a new effort to read through the Hebrew Bible. My Bible intake has waned in recent years, dipping at times to essentially zero. The Bible Project has been a source of inspiration and delight for months now, and I'm grateful for it, but I've begun to use it as a crutch. In a desire to read the Bible with the rich layers that Tim and John reveal, I've hoped that I'll learn how to explore the Bible that way by listening to many, many examples. But I remember now that I've read the Bible from the beginning with an awareness, albeit limited, of its interconnected and patterned nature. This is not a new skill, but a growing skill.

I'm reading three segments of the Hebrew Bible in tandem: Torah, Prophets, and Writings.
