Amie flew to Maine this morning. Graham, Royal and I woke early to drive her to the airport. We went straight to the skate park in Niles afterward.

The boys have done extremely well today, even though at times they miss their mama. Graham has his moments but for the most part he's very helpful. We spent almost two hours at the skate park with no meltdowns or crazy-making.

We ate lunch a half-hour early because Royal was sleepy. He didn't put up a fuss when I placed him into bed. Graham played quietly while I took a shower, then an hour-long nap. He didn't want snuggles nor did he demand television.

Royal was awake shortly after I awoke. We grabbed a snack and headed for the Chicago Botanic Gardens. To my surprise and delight, the jack-o-lanterns were out! Royal squealed with delight over and over; he never seemed to tire of looking at them. Graham sat in the stroller mostly, but I think he was having a good time. We needed to turn back because it takes so long for Royal to walk anywhere, but Graham agreed to hold Royal in his lap and we did the entire circuit.

I cooked mozzarella ravioli for us when we made it home, and the boys ate decently well. Then we played chase before Royal's bedtime. When Royal was settled, Graham and I did something he never gets to do - we watched a little of a shark documentary. Probably should have vetted it before we began - I thought it was scary - but I guess we'll see if it affects Graham. The Jippy and Dumper tale was about meeting a shark so hopefully we were able to process the experience together ðŸ¤ž.
