For our 7th anniversary Amie and I went out to dinner at {{< outref name="Big Jones" src="https://www.bigjoneschicago.com/" >}}. We don't often get out after bedtime but Amie's mom stayed with the kiddos so we could have a relaxed evening. If we ever leave Chicago we'll sure miss the world-class dining.
