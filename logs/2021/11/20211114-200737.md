We made the mistake of visiting the Kohl Children's Museum on a weekend. So many people... But we managed to get a few photos that'll serve as better memories than the press of crowds, the noise of a hundred toddlers, and the price of admission.

{{< caption caption="This little boy pushed Royal right after this photo, but he took it well. Life with Graham has built his resiliency." alt="Royal in a play car next to another boy in a crowded room. They're staring at one another." src="https://images.alexbilson.dev/20211113_102125.webp" >}}

{{< caption caption="There were three train tables where Graham spent most of his time. When he gets time to sink into play, he's happily focused." alt="Graham playing with a wooden train set, the piece that rotates to select a new track." src="https://images.alexbilson.dev/20211113_105503.webp" >}}
