A clear conception of my site's purpose is a continual struggle. I discover an idea from another's site, plan out an implementation on my own, then realize that I'm merging unclear concepts together into an unusable mishmash. Recently, it's been Nick's [Commonplace Book](https://barnsworthburning.net) and Andy's [Working Notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes).

What I love about the commonplace book is that it builds a topical context. It's a highly curated source of inspiration. But it's not designed per-se to write insights. The working notes is a curated thinking tool that can spark insights by growing a complex web of interrelated, atomic ideas. But it lacks a wider context from which to draw inspiration and cross-discipline connections. Perhaps there's a way to combine the best of both?
