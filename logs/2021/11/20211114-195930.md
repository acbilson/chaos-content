Amie and I took a date night last Friday at the Botanic Garden's [Lightscape](https://www.chicagobotanic.org/lightscape) event. Here are a selection of photos. It snowed the entire time, but you could hardly tell. The effect that the snow had on the colors, however, was beyond description. It was the most awesome worship service I've attended in a long time.

Unlike most pictures, the colors stand out more in the photo than I noticed live!" alt="Amie standing in a courtyard colored like a stained glass window from light cast by a many-colored cube." src="https://images.alexbilson.dev/20211112_204052.webp" >}}
