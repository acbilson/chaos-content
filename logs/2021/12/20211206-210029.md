My first opportunity to meet my Performance Trust colleagues occurred over a year after I started at the company! The IT department hosted a party at [Topgolf](https://goo.gl/maps/XeUCM8BduwdSB7FM8). It was a delightful three hours spent with great colleagues, delicious food and swinging entertainment.
