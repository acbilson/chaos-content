We couldn't secure babysitting for Royal, so yesterday Amie and I split up and took the boys in a special trip separately.

Graham and Amie rode the Metra train downtown. He was so excited! They walked over to see the Macy's Christmas windows, then back to the station. They had planned to visit Kriskindlemarket, but the line wrapped the block.

Royal and I drove to the Lincoln Park Zoo. We saw all sorts of animals: giraffe, zebra and meercat in the Africa exhibit; snake, lizard, bat, and armadillo in the mammal/reptile exhibit, many birds in the bird exhibit, and monkey, seal, camel and squirrel outside.
