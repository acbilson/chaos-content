It's been over a year since the spark of desire to introduce the nations to Jesus was rekindled in our hearts. We'd thought an open door was before us to share our gifts alongside like-minded believers for the sake of the many nations in Chicago, but it's not as we'd hoped.

Ted Kim shares with Jared Boyd a beautiful vision of spiritual formation through communal spiritual practices, but the missional emphasis is left to the individual's growth with Jesus.

Strict adherence to the adage that we can give others only what we have - a Biblical concept (see Matthew 12:35) - has overpowered two equal realities..

First, our treasure is external to us. His words and presence are not limited by the vessel's spiritual vitality. We are not batteries that must be charged in order to emit light. Though spiritual practices are essential to all disciples, mission is not contingent or subsequent to our personal growth.

Second, even the highest quality spiritual life does not equip our community to share their treasure. Sharing Jesus, fraught with mistakes, leads to experience. Experience, fostered in community with story and reflection, produces disciples. Disciples who can pass to their neighbors what they're learning makes disciple-making disciples. And disciple-making disciples spark movements and revival.
