Royal's toddering hard these days. Resistant to changing clothes, walking to the car and sitting in his car seat; the mornings are a wrestling match to move him out the door. He doesn't give me the same resistance that he gives Amie, probably because I'll just man-handle him, so it's even more frustrating when she's trying to contain his flailing body.

Reminds me that I still need to get that custom shirt made, the one with crossed AK-47s that reads, "I don't negotiate with toddlers."
