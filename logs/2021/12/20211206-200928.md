Amie, Graham, Royal and I spent a lovely visit with my Uncle Mark, Aunt Steph and Viktoria in Grand Rapids; our Thanksgiving tradition for the past seven years!

This year was more restful than we've experienced since Graham was born. In part because none of us was under a year old, and also sleeping in the same room seemed to help. We also made record time on the drive over, arriving almost an hour earlier than we expected. That worked out great since we were able to contribute a little to the dinner prep this time around. And as we have most years, we brought board games to play.

It was snowing the whole time so that, by the time he'd cleared it there was another layer. Endless fun!" alt="Graham staring at the camera from outside a garage with snow on his coat and hat." src="https://images.alexbilson.dev/20211127_104813.webp" >}}
