We had a lovely double-date with David and Sharon Ello at Lady Gregory's last Friday. Not only was it a miracle that we both found babysitters on short notice (thank you Kati Ray!), but we were able to get a seat in less than five minutes when we were told it'd take a half-hour.

We've spent the last few months praying with them and listening for God's direction for our households. The Spirit has led them to move-a bittersweet answer; my plan was to get them to move into _our_ building-and given us encouragement that's led to pressing further into our apostolic gifting.

Be blessed my friends; may the LORD bless you and your household with joy and peace that overflows the streets of your neighborhood.
