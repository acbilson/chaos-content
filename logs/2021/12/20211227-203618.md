Despite our boy's horrific sickness and a sleepless night, Christmas day was marvelously executed.

On Christmas Eve, Amie and I decorated the ceiling with stars, the table with cloth and candles, the bookshelf with stockings, and the tree with presents; one for each person. I attempted to install a swing clasp to the ceiling but, after three holes drilled without hitting wood, we chose another Christmas gift until we could request help.

Graham exclaimed, "This is so exciting!" when he noticed the transformation. Royal sleepily ignored the festivities, but he warmed once we began to unpack the stockings.

Stockings are the centerpiece of Christmas gift-giving, now that we open but one package apiece. Most items are individually wrapped for greater paper-tearing fun.

Interspersed throughout the morning were calls with family, then the longed-for lunchtime nap.

Kati Ray was over for Christmas dinner; a lavish affair of turkey breast, mashed potatoes, carrot souffl√©, potato-bread loaves, fruit salad and Le Sueur peas. We merrily enjoyed the feast, put the boys to bed, and consumed two-thirds of Kati's chocolate pear pie while watching the first episode of [The Chosen](https://www.amazon.com/The-Chosen-season-1/dp/B091D6KCBS).
