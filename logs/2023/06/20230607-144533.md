For Graham's birthday he and I went on our first camping trip together!

We set up the tent, explored the area, started a campfire, and roasted hot dogs and s'mores. Graham was so excited the first night that he couldn't stop moving until nearly nine o'clock.

Since we had to reserve at least two nights, we picked up Amie and Royal and all of us stayed overnight for the second evening.

Graham had to work through some feelings when we arrived back at the campsite with Amie and Royal. He was happy that Royal was there, but also disappointed that he no longer enjoyed the woods undisturbed. But he and Royal got through it and had a glorious time pretending to be pterodactyls.

My friends Tommy, Gerry, Kim and Jennifer dropped in at the campsite. They're in the Black Hills looking for a plot of land to bootstrap a retreat center. So glad we could visit with them!

Not long after the boys were put to bed it began to rain. Amie and I sat in the car to chat, but when we went to our tents I discovered Royal fast asleep on an island in the center of a pool of rainwater. I was ready to call it quits but Amie suggested we could fit into the two-person with she and Graham. So that's what we did, though I joked that I'll have more room in my coffin.

In spite of the tight squeeze and being cold, both boys thought the camping trip was spectacular and can't wait to go again.
