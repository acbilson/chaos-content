Amie and I went to our first play of the year at Black Hills Playhouse. What an enchanting venue, nestled deep in the Ponderosa pine, a tinkling creek winding between the campus buildings, and the cabin smell of the impressively professional stage room.

The play was outstanding. Funny, thought-provoking, and engrossing. When it travels, see it where you are.
