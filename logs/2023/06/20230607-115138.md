We were amazed to discover that a friend of Amie's, Jim Walker, from her days in Pittsburgh was riding the bus to Crazy Horse Memorial with us! He's suffered terribly in the intervening years since the Hot Metal church plant, but Holy Spirit sent Amie and I to encourage him that his work has not been in vain.
