After the #dmm summit, two priorities were impressed upon me: to focus on my family as my primary team of disciple-makers, and to lean into warfare #prayer.

Amie and I have enjoyed several conversations about team Bilson. Amie and I are praying together more than ever, and I'm praying with the boys some too.

Last Saturday the Spirit offered me an awesome chance to inspire a men's meeting towards prayer, and tomorrow my friend who owns a rock-climbing gym will be over to pray.

So excited!
