Amie's been sharing lots of crafts with the boys in the last week. I'm so impressed by her thoughtfulness and creativity. She'd say that the ideas came from others, but it's her inspiration that implements them for our boys.

One such project was swirling color into a pan full of shaving cream. In the first try, the color never made it to the pan. But in the second, when Amie smoothed the shaving cream herself, they added some color!

This project was an inspiration from Black History Month. It's their space paintings.

And this craft is to make flowers using cupcake holders on popsicle sticks.

Amie and the boys built this awesome marble run with some PVC pipe we'd gotten for a Halloween costume last year.

Graham purchased a volcano kit with his birthday money last year.
