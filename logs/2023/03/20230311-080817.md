Last Thursday our neighbors came over for a last-minute #DiscoveryBibleStudy. We read Jesus’ kingdom parable where the farmer plants wheat but an enemy sows weeds.

We sped through with only an hour for a group of six. Had a slightly heated discussion about interpreting since Jesus actually does explain this one later.

It was personally fruitful to realize that the farmhands’ question was central to understanding the parable, but Jesus curiously leaves them out of his explanation.
