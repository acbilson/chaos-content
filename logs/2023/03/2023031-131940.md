Since we were sick with the flu the first two weeks of February the habits of exercise, meditation and memorization that started so well in January need a jumpstart.

I've found that since the flu, #qigong breathing exercises have required more focus than before. My body is still distressed even though flu symptoms have faded.

In #exercise, I'd just started two sets before illness and it's kicking my butt now. Slowly starting to build up motivation.

#Memorization is at a standstill.
