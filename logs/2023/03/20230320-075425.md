Graham started with a cough a few days ago and Royal had croup-style breathing all last night. Amie's next, then after her, me.

It helps to look at prior logs to see when we were last sick. Mid-February as it turns out. So almost five weeks well! That's a record in the Bilson family household.

Of course, this happens a few days before the special birthday trip Amie planned for me ðŸ˜©. At least Royal was well for his birthday celebration.
