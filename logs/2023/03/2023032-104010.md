Amie and I have been reading The Mysterious Benedict Society series by Trenton Lee Stewart. We’re almost through the second #book.

The characters are so great. Milligan’s monologue in the first book is captivating. Constance is a riot (and very like a toddler - I should know), and Kate is my favorite.

The boys will probably love this series when they can read.
