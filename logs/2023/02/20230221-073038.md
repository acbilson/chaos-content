I'm grateful that yesterday was a bank holiday. It was good to have an extra day off after illness to remember what's important.

Amie and I enjoyed a date morning at a local Australian coffee shop that almost felt like we were back in Chicago. In the afternoon I met up with Andrew at Westminster for a chat about work, #dmm, and prayer. We've got an evening of prayer for his rock-climbing business on the calendar in a couple weeks.
