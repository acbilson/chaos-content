I built a local demo site with the #11ty static-site generator (#SSG). I was particularly interested in the #WebC template for vanilla #WebComponents. It was a cinch to write web components that are integrated into another template language like Nunjucks. Win!

The documentation is poor. I needed an overview of the build steps and configuration options, but thatâ€™s not forthcoming. However, I have enough experience with the tools to get stuff working, along with example sites on GitHub.
