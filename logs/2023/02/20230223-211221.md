In my early 20’s guilt followed any “unproductive” time. As a parent in my early 30’s the guilt is less pronounced. I’ve come to realize that true down time pays for itself in more energy tomorrow.

What has not ceased to bother me, however, are those times when I am unproductive, not for resting, but to hide from my feelings.

Anyways, time to read The Farthest Shore by Ursula K Le Guin.
