I no longer have flu symptoms, but was still fatigued when we hosted our friends yesterday. I’m so glad we did.

The boys and Skyler’s kids had a great time for the most part. Skyler and I talked about #qigong, #evolution, stages of #faith development, out of body experiences, dreams and visions, invisible spiritual #evil and more. It’s validating to my conviction that I must learn more effectively to fight spiritual battles. And nice not to feel so lonely.
