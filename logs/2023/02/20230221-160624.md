The DMM Summit in Mesa, AZ three weeks back was inspiring and life-giving. I'm so happy to have met others in the region who share our passion! Many of the talks have been uploaded to [the DMM YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@DiscipleMakingMovements); I'm sending links to friends and re-watching them with Amie.

There were a couple key take-aways.

First, our team is primary and foremost the four of us (me, Amie, Graham and Royal). I am asking Jesus about how to equip and support my little family as a team of disciple-making disciples. This is a monumental task and I'm still working out how to break it down into achievable milestones.

Second, I need to improve how I engage with invisible spiritual powers. This is a life theme that Jesus is reminding me of again, and I am exploring how to train.

While I was in Arizona, Amie, Jaynne, Wes, Graham and Royal were hard at work priming and painting our entire vaulted living room. I was so surprised when I walked through the door!
