What is it about arriving in Chicago that stirs up so much resistance?

We were hanging out with the Ellos, reflecting on our family's sudden illness that just happened to coincide with our drive to Chicago, when we realized that all our crazy stories occur, not on the way _out_ of Chicago, but on the way _back_.

This realization stirs up my rebel side. I wanna move back just to send a message, "You can't push me around."

Anyways, we've all been ill since the day before we drove out. Almost every meet up we've hoped for was cancelled, either because we were sick or they were (it seems the whole world is sick this week). My original reason for driving to Chicago, to attend my work's IT conference in person, was almost completely invalidated. I spent the first day in the dining room of our AirBnB tuned into the conference online.  But, even though I only had five broken hours of sleep last night, I'm in the office now. As we say in our household, "Bilson's can do hard things."
