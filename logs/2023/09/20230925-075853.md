I've been reflecting on how to communicate my own mortality to my boys. It's had the unexpected affect of turning my view towards those I've lost and what I trust has happened to our relationship. I will see them again at the resurrection of the living and the dead, yet their absence from my life pains Jesus as it does myself. Together we will bear the suffering while the Father supplies what I need. And so the Father shall offer my boys when I have passed on.
