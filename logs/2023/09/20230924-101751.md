While visiting the Ellos in Arlington Heights David gave us a word. He said our family is like a tornado. While it can seem quiet inside, all those around are getting tossed around and stirred up.

Thatâ€™s a good word brother. Bring the wind, Spirit, bring the change. Give us the endurance to live inside the storm.
