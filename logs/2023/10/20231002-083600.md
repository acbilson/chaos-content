For the first time this year a person joined me on one of my Centennial Trail hikes!

Skyler and I managed a 7-mile hike from Brush Creek to Sheridan Lake. It was actually closer to nine miles after we lost the trail and backtracked. My hamstrings are still tight.

Since all my hikes have been alone, I wasn't sure how to behave. Should we talk, or hike in silence? It turned out to be a mix of both.

I'm grateful to have gotten to know Skyler a little more. We've been working together to integrate DBS questions and facilitation techniques into the youth program's Wednesday meetings. I'd seen his passion for mentorship but I hadn't grasped his love and expertise in communication. Now I kinda want to work on my public speaking skills; there's a Toastmaster's meet up on Saturday mornings I could probably attend.
