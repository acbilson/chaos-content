On the 13th of September, right before we left for Chicago, Skyler launched this year's youth ministry at Westminster. I had the joy of collaborating with him on the design and the privilege of helping with the launch. Skyler's taken the ministry over from Andrew after he followed the Spirit's leading to pivot towards the Basecamp Climbing Gym community full-time.

> We're equipping Middle School and High School kids to discover the Biblical Jesus in the book of Mark by reading the Bible in community, responding to what we've learned and sharing our discoveries with those we know. It's so exciting!

That first night I facilitated a reading of the first passage in Mark with mostly Middle Schoolers. I wasn't prepared for how challenging it would be.

One of the strongest personalities interrupted every two minutes asking if it was over yet. I never got the breathing room I'm accustomed to and so the whole time felt rushed and burdensome. I was flustered. When I heard how Skyler's group of mostly High Schoolers had responded, however, I was encouraged.

I missed the next Wednesday but made it for the third. Again Skyler and I each took a group but this time I had more High Schoolers. So much easier! It was a joy to see everyone participate. We even did a group I WILL: 15 seconds of listening for Jesus' voice. I don't know what else Jesus may have done in others but I saw the image of a lighthouse. May these folks know themselves to be lights in the world and salt upon the earth!

This Wednesday Skyler and I will take a backseat for another to facilitate. It would be a win if either adults or youth would facilitate, but youth would be the most awesome. I'm asking for God's courage for Tyler and Selah, and also Becky among the adults.
