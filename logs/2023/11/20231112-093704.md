Yesterday was well spent for an ebb day. I had zero accomplishments but, by simply being a warm body, I could drive Graham and Royal to Heather's birthday party and handle bedtime so Amie could go to dinner and a play with her father. What a strange tangle are my priorities at times that kindness and service can be discounted while intellectual pursuit is sought.
