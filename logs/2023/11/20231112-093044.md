The ebb and flow of my life can be abrasive, wearing me down like sand upon the smooth stones of the sea shore. My perspective has softened towards myself in the ebb, but I am not fully free of the surges of shame that accompany ebbs or the bursts of unceasing energy that mark flows. I am either an ideal or a poor candidate for a monastic order. It depends on one's goal.
