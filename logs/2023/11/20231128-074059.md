This weekend we pulled out all the carpet in the house, two rooms and four half-stairs, in preparation for the new carpet installation. The contractors installed it all yesterday!

I'd moved our books out of the bookshelves so I could move them downstairs. I found Graham and Royal sitting on a pile of them and let out a yell so loud Graham immediately started crying. I apologized for scaring Graham.

Next time I need to lower the volume, but I'm finding that yelling gets the rage out faster than stuffing and means I'm capable of responding kindly much sooner (not yelling _at_, but a loud release of emotion. Amazing what one can learn from one's own children ðŸ™‚).
