Amie and I enjoyed a relaxed planning session last night. There’s so much, if the Lord wills, that we anticipate in the new year.

Our downstairs bedroom will finally be complete. Just in time to use as an office for Amie’s counseling work in January. I’ll be starting a postulancy with the Order of the Common Life. I’m learning to let go in order to pursue further Kingdom work. And we’ll be hosting a Christmas party.
