I was explaining prompt engineering to Amie yesterday by sharing that AI can be trained to generate representations of character dialog, say Bart Simpson for example.

Instead of getting into the mind of Bart and writing all the new dialog for another episode, a writer could instead dialog with an AI to hone it's impersonation of a character. Teach it to BE Bart Simpson.

I think a lot of the creativity remains, but now via computer dialog. And you move on to a new character.

For my part this actually sounds like a lot of fun. Instead of inventing lines for one scene of dialog in the next episode of The Next Best Thing™️, you could chat with the computer to fill out the character's personality and history, give it the scenario, and let it generate the dialog.

"Hmmm, that's not quite right, computer. Sorry, I mean Sonny. You're skeptical about Fred because he stole that pencil from you in the 3rd grade. You know, before your parents moved to Seattle."
