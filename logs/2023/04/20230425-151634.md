Today is ultra-full.

- Finished up a project to pull holding company data into our system and demoed the results to our DBA. Quick win.
- Consulted with a board director about a global software project. May have the honor of assisting with the design of the project on a data committee. Really exciting.
- A bunch of calls with various people in my work and neighborhood. Doing some trail maintenance with the family on Saturday and playing Sleeping Gods with a friend on Thursday.
- And, tonight, we're hosting a couple who lead a house church nearby.

So grateful Amie got me that 20oz latte this morning! ðŸ˜˜
