This is the most rational and persuasive plea to read the Bible I've ever read. My favorite quote:

"...the majority of [Christians] arenâ€™t actually familiar with what the Bible says. Too many use the Bible as a self-help book that they read whenever they need a pick-me-up, while others use it mainly as a tool to manipulate others or make more money."
