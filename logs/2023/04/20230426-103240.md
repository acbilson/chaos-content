Just hours before our neighbors were coming over for tacos and fellowship they came down with a violent illness. We ran the tacos over to them anyways, but I'm annoyed when it seems our adversary has gotten the upper hand. The spiteful, petty resistance is wearisome.

It reminds me of the behavior of the Unman in C.S. Lewis' Perelandra.

"What chilled and almost cowed him was the union of malice with something nearly childish... this petty, indefatigable nagging..."

But victory will be mine.
