My dad and Shawna visited the second weekend in July.

One lunch we spent at a firehouse restaurant up in the Black Hills. Graham and Royal climbed all over every firetruck they had parked outside and into every compartment.

We visited the candy store afterward. To our surprise, not only did we find candy, but also this enormous moth! Royal insisted we take it home.

Another time we went on a cave tour.

It was a short trip, but everyone had a great time!
