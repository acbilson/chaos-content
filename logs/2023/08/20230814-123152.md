For our ninth anniversary Amie and I returned to Skogen Kitchen and, for the first time in our lives, we tried foie gras.

We'd wondered about this dish ever since reading about it in one of Ruth Reichl's books, but rarely see it on the menu.

This is also likely the _last_ time I will ever eat it.
