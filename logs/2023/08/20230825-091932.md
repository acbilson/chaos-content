Our September will be packed. It begins with Amie traveling to the East Coast for a wedding. Then I train a group of adults and high schoolers in the Discovery Bible Study method (Iâ€™m really excited about this). After that we drive to Chicago for a week of visiting and a work conference. And I might try to squeeze in a day hike.
