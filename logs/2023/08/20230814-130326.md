Amie and I have finished Trenton Lee Stewart's "The Mysterious Benedict Society" [boxed set](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-mysterious-benedict-society-paperback-boxed-set-trenton-lee-stewart/14573553?ean=9780316460965). I'm sorry to see it go; we really enjoyed them.

We've begun a trilogy about a family's life on the island of Corfu. Although we're only a chapter in, there's an exceptional quality to the writing. And it's _funny_. Gerald Durrell has keen perception to say the least.
