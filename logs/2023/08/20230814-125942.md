Amie is growing a number of edible plants in pots on our front porch, such as jalapeños.

Yesterday, Royal had found a plucked jalapeño and mistakenly bit a swallowed a chunk. He was in agony while we tried to figure out what had happened until Amie noticed the half-eaten jalapeño on the floor. Once we knew what was going on I rubbed ice on Royal's lips for almost a half hour until the oily burn finally subsided.

If Royal's other choices are any indication this will not deter him from trying again, even another jalapeño.
