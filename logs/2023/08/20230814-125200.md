In Amie's Present Play cohort (now called Hi Fam! I believe) she's chosen a three-month project to hold a special weekly meal called "family feast." It's a meal that, more than any other, is for connection and tradition. We had our fourth meal yesterday.

We've made adjustments every week since we began, trying to find a time, food, and location that's conducive to mutual enjoyment. I don't think we've quite figured it out yet.
