“Write about what interests you.”

What interests me right now are video games and the TV show Suits. I wouldn’t write about them because they’re not important enough. They’re entertainment.

Except that I’m an analyst. Where others watch a show or play a game and happily move on, I must master it. If it’s a game: memorize the tactics and devise the perfect strategy. If it’s a show, ascertain the characters next moves and the writer’s plot structure. So should I write about these topics too?
