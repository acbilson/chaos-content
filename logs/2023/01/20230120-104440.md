I'm trying out the Arc browser today. I have some hesitancy about using another browser than Safari; what if I like it and it goes away? But experiencing new ways to explore the Web is worth it.

What intrigues me most is the note and easel integration. I think these, combined with split panes, could make research feel more fluid.
