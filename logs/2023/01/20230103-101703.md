Yesterday was one of the most consistently fun days in recent memory.

It started with a miracle; the boys slept until 8:15! We had an easy breakfast, then headed to the premier sledding hill around 11:00.

We left for lunch well before any meltdown could happen (we were also well stocked on snacks) and went to Sheels to purchase Graham a pair of new gloves. Amie and I picked up Noodles & Co. and I enjoyed a brief chat with Tommy.

We drove around for a half-hour to let Royal take a nap, but he never fell asleep. And to my surprise, the boys were willing to go back to the sledding hill. So that's exactly what we did.

Royal was really upset when some boys accidentally decapitated a snowman he'd helped build, so we built our own in the front yard.

We opened our Christmas packages from Memaw-campfire poles-and I built a fire to keep us warm and to grill hot dogs.

All of that would have made it a wonderful day, but then we also played a game of Terraforming Mars! ðŸ¥³
