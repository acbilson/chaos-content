One of our favorite places to hike is the Flume Trail. We've been up to the tunnels on several occasions, but this this our first time when the river's frozen over.

At this extreme latitude the sun makes a low arc over the horizon rather than an overhead crossing which produces hills brown on one half and white on the other. Magical.
