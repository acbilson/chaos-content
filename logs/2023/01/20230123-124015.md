I attempted something unusual today.

I've been reading about Qi (pronounced 'chi') and pondering the breathing and movement principles in #qigong and #taiji. I'm so ignorant, but curiosity will cure that in time.

Anyways, so I (poorly) attempted to emulate forms I've seen in an act of both internal regulation and external worship. Now I wonder: what's been written about #qi/#chi and Christian #worship?

This is all in service of developing personal spiritual disciplines for my season of life.
