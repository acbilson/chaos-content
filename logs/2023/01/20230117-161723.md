In honor of Martin Luther King Jr., Amie and I watched [Descendant](https://www.descendantfilm.com) last night.

One of the unanswered questions about the horror of Clotilda's theft of one-hundred and ten people from Africa to slavery in Mobile, Alabama in 1859 is the question of justice. How does one make right such a grevious wrong? There was no satisfactory answer.

Somehow the transfer of assets from the Meaher estate to his captives feels insufficient. I wonder if the insufficiency of financial restitution lies in the absence of purification? It may be true that {{< backref src="/plants/faith/restoration-demands-both-justice-and-purification" >}}.
