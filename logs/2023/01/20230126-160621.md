Good progress so far. Have the first three chapters of Hebrews memorized, and starting on the first portion of the next. ðŸ¥³

Now that I have a good chunk in my cranium I'll need more organization to keep from losing my place. Currently I'm seeing a strong relationship between the first two chapters, then 3:1-4:14.
