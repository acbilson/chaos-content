David Ello gave me a recommendation for a new book series, [Peter and the Starcatchers](https://bookshop.org/p/books/peter-and-the-starcatchers-peter-and-the-starcatchers-book-one-ridley-pearson/286318?ean=9780786849079). Looks like my kind of book!

We're hoping to start the first book of the [Corfu Trilogy](https://a.co/d/h9bFcaU) by Gerald Durrell once we've finished The Extraordinary Education of Nicolas Benedict by Trenton Lee Stewart... and as soon as the order returns the correct book.

We hastily attempted to use Walmart. They sent us Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway instead. At least it was a classic...
