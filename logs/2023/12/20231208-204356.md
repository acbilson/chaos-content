My second day off was spent with my sons, and that’s made these some of my favorite days.

Today, Royal and I spent the afternoon together. We visited the Geology museum on the School of Mines campus and saw some spectacular rocks and fossils. Then we went ice skating for the first time.

Doing things with both boys can be fun, but my favorite is when we’re one-on-one. I’m hoping to do something similar with Graham soon; he’ll love the museum and _might_ like ice skating.
