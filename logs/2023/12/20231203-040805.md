Lastly, the symphony is nostalgic, prophetic and FUN. At times I struggle to be "proper" because I want to dance and mourn, in all my ungainly, unskilled movements, along with the music. I don't (in the concert hall at least ðŸ˜‰), but I allow my body to move with the music in my seat. Sometimes I feel self-conscious when I realize that almost no one else is doing the same ðŸ˜¨, but bucking conformity brings it's own satisfaction. It's worth discomfort to feel the texture of the music in my flesh.
