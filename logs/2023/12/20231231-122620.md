I’ve enjoyed this holiday season more than last year by a wide margin. However, I’m still weary of being tired for days with little to show for it.

I am daunted by this new year and unsure of myself as I enter it. Tonight we’ll do some goal setting which usually helps; putting it all in the table and sorting out the best from the good often relieves the burden of over-the-limit dreams.

Anyways, for now just gotta eat lunch and take Graham ice skating. Baby steps.
