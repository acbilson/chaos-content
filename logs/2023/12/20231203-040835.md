A big part of what made this symphony especially fun was the Davis Sisters: Dee+Shapeera, Kandra and LaDreeva. Their joy and comfort singing together and the astounding range of their talents is a blessing. My only gripe is that none of the vocals speakers were pointed towards the balcony!

We may be becoming part-time groupies of Kandra and LaDreeva if we keep showing up to their local gigs ♥️.
