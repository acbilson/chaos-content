One week until Christmas!

Amie and I wrapped the stocking-stuffers last night. The boys will be _thrilled_. With Amie's dad's help we've finished the bed in the guest bedroom. Our task list is dwindling, although our Christmas cards are doomed to arrive late again this year. I'm enjoying this season way more than last; there's lots to do but it doesn't feel like work is all there is.
