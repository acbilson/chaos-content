The symphony is nostalgic, and it's also prophetic. The Spirit flows with the music, calling images and memories to my mind's eye in a way that's often surprising. That is, in ways I cannot anticipate or control. Those movements in which I expect to receive the strongest impressions can be lifeless to me, and others can bring me to tears with their resonance and imagery. I think that I learned to hear the Spirit's voice first through music, then recognized the speaker in the Bible.
