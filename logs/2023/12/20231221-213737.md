Today I used two skills from high school. Two!

First, geometry. Using the Pythagorean Theorem and SOACATOA (remember that?) I calculated the necessary height of a screw to install a rail.

Second, checking my work. I had to look up all the stuff about cosines and such because I didn’t remember any of it. Even when I applied it, I wasn’t sure that I had it right. So I created a couple control problems and validated my results.

#geometry rocks!
