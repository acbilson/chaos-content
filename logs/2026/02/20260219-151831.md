I’ve been so proud of Graham for persisting in his violin practice. Whether he continues after this year or not, he’s exercising the right internal locus muscles. Practicing even when it’s boring, or when mastery feels unattainable, or when you’re not ready to perform before your peers and the test is tomorrow: all of these are bring up strong emotions that he’s experiencing, processing, and moving through. Well done buddy!
