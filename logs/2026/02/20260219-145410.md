Amie turned me on to the Warriors album. I’ve never watched the movie; just learning the story through Lin-Manuel Miranda, Eisa Davis, Ms. Lauryn Hill and others’ eyes has been richly rewarding.

There are so many memorable moments, but one I’ve been appreciating is the reaction by the Riffs after their leader, Cyrus, is shot in the song Still Breathin’.

“What do you do when they kill everything you believe in, but you’re still breathin’?”

The pain and confusion is visceral, just as it must have been with the early disciples after their leader, Jesus, was put to death by their religious leaders.
