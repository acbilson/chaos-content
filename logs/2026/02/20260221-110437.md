I’ve been exploring what it will take to start a PhD since last Fall. Since reading Umberto Ecco’s How to Write a Thesis over five years ago, I’ve kept in the back of my mind a curiosity. In what subject would I want to add a brick to the tower of human understanding? It needs to be a subject I can research exhaustively for six plus years without giving up or losing interest.

The subject which has engulfed more of my mental and emotional energy than any other these past thirteen years has been the shape and movement of the Church in the United States. I’ve written some of my thoughts in a {{< backref src="/plants/faith/kingdom-manifesto" >}}, and have spent hundreds of hours facilitating DBS studies in a variety of contexts. I would happily invest hundreds more in research, debate and practice. I would prefer to do so in the framework of a PhD program, if I can get my foot in the door.
