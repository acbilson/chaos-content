I've been sporadically learning a new keyboard layout, the Workman layout. I'd tried learning Dvorak a while ago and had some success, so I have courage to try again. Getting off QWERTY is one of many steps I'm taking to reduce strain on my body, especially my wrists. [Typing lessons](https://www.keybr.com/) are extremely effective!
