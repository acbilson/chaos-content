Matthew Kudija has written notes for a list of books, astonishing for both its prodigious length and breadth of subject matter. Here are a few book notes that revealed books I'd love to read.

- [The Bitcoin Standard](https://matthewkudija.com/reading-notes/2021-03-14-The-Bitcoin-Standard.html)

I know little about Bitcoin but am interested in economics and curious about this upstart monetary system.

- [How To Talk About Books You Haven't Read](https://matthewkudija.com/reading-notes/2021-06-01-How-to-Talk-About-Books-You-Haven't-Read.html)

The title drew me in. It reminds me of an invaluable book I'd read years ago (I don't remember the title) that gave me freedom to _not_ finish many books.

- [Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder](https://matthewkudija.com/reading-notes/2020-12-21-Antifragile.html)

Nassim Taleb's name keeps popping up. This looks like a great place to start with his work.

- [The 48 Laws of Power](https://matthewkudija.com/reading-notes/2014-06-05-The-48-Laws-of-Power.html)

Since Matthew has written the laws down, I probably don't need to read the book. But I would like to compare/contrast these with Jesus' style of power.

- [Finding Darwin's God](https://matthewkudija.com/reading-notes/2014-08-07-Finding-Darwin%E2%80%99s-God.html)

This would be a great way to continue my re-introduction with evolution after _Adam and the Genome_.
