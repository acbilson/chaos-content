I've had a downward swing in writing lately, but in the overarching spread of this website, one month of abscence in nearly four years ain't bad. I return at the eve of our 10th wedding anniversary celebration trip to Italy, so my next post will likely be dedicated to that much-anticipated vacation.

One of my purposes for compiling my writing here is the effect that years of writing in the same place has on my sense of accomplishment. Even if I'm sporadic, even if I take long breaks or produce work that I'm less than proud of, the accretion of work over time measures up. It's easy to find again, to reference, and to share. Being a website, it also sometimes scratches my itch for tinkering with code and design. I do sometimes feel that the whole thing has become a big pile of mud and pressure myself to try and organize the behemoth (1290 files and counting), but when I let go of this unnecessary pressure I remember the enjoyment I've had writing on topics without needing to be perfectly professional and the pride I feel at seeing the years of writing I've invested. So, even if it looks like my website has gone dormant, it's only temporary.
