Back in August our neighbors pulled out a gas-powered scooter their adult son had enjoyed as a kid. The brakes didn't work anymore, but that didn't deter Graham. I was very proud of him for getting up the courage to ask if he could have a ride. He ended up going three times! Even Royal took a spin.
