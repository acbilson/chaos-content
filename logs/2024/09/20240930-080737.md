Last night was our Leader's Kickoff gathering. It was fantastic. But wow, were there obstacles.

Andrew arrived punctually at 5:00, but he was stressed because he'd left his board game group by themselves at Westgate. He's the only connection to the church and holds the keys, so leaving for two hours near the end of a board game session was tough.

Kandra arrived a half-hour late with Eden and Qingsley, which ultimately was a blessing since it meant that the Bascom's weren't the only ones.

Skyler, Amanda, Elovie, Sonny, Ingrid and Opal arrived an hour late, for good reason. They'd just gotten up from a nap which went longer than planned, and Skyler was in such pain from a recent foot injury that he'd hardly slept and didn't want to come. I called Skyler at 5:45 to hear how he was doing and offer to take him to Urgent Care. They decided to come late (for which I'm so thankful), in no small part because the kids were so disappointed about staying home.

Still, the most important things weren't an obstacle. The group was unusually open and supportive and landed on a day that everyone could meet in less than five minutes. The kids, all eight of them, had a great time and did well playing downstairs while the adults talked. And we had time to pray for Skyler's foot at the end.
