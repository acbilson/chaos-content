In the space of a few hours I’ve done work across at least three technical domains that are usually each their own jobs.

First, I’ve used the Python Django Framework to model a menu and location admin service. Second, I’ve designed a responsive, themed website for one of my favorite food trucks. Third, I’ve established an Ansible deployment service to send my latest creation to the Internet.

On the one hand, I’m proud of myself for gaining all the proficiencies required to do the jobs of three people. On the other, I’m disappointed that I derailed my schedule for a fan site.
