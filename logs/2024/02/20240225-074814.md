We reserved our 10th anniversary adventure trip yesterday night. Weâ€™ll be staying at a family-owned lemon farm near the Amalfi coast. It will be our first time visiting Italy; a mixture of good food, hiking, and site-seeing. With a little planning it will also be my MBA  celebration and a celebration of perseverance towards Amieâ€™s licensure. (We have a celebration backlog ðŸ˜„)
