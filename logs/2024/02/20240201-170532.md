Today is Amie and Amanda’s first women’s DBS since the holiday break. They’ll be meeting weekly this round. The details of what they’ll study are still to be decided, either a theme or a continuation of Mark. So excited for them!

I learned that another person at my work is interested in moving to another team. This means that, when I start the next project for another team, I may have a place to remain on that team instead of returning to the Portal team. I’m not sure if this is a good thing yet, but since Mike is also taking over that team it’ll mean my reporting structure remains the same. So it can’t go that bad. Can’t wait for a new project!
