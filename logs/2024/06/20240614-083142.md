We've been steadily shaping the backyard since April. We're not landscapers by any means and are making it up as we go along, but it's feeling more habitable with each step we take. Next up is carving walls into the hill where we've planted our serviceberry tree and placing brick stones.

The boys could care less about the aesthetics, but they're loving all the dirt for digging and finding earthworms.
