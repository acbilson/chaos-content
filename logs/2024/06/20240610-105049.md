So, Graham's been wanting to ride his bike to school for a couple months, but we weren't ready to let him cross the busy road to his school on his own. I had proposed to Graham that we run some trial rides to give him practice before we graduate to a trip to school.

First, Graham rode two blocks away and back. He took a walkie-talkie so he could check in at every crossing. The batteries died along the way so, when he returned, we went to Walgreens for some AAAs.

I thought he'd be proud and satisfied with his progress, but he was itching to amp up the challenge at a busier intersection. I couldn't bring myself to let him cross without eyes on him, but I set him up with a busier road and watched from a few yards away. He waited for cars to stop at the crosswalk on both sides, then crossed like a champ.

As soon as he finished, he asked to cross a four-lane intersection. I sighed, agreed, and set him up with another trial. This time he had a walking signal, and he followed it perfectly.

But still he wasn't satisfied. So we drove to his school, walked through the whole process he'd go through to get his bike, radio in that he was leaving, cross the busy road, and ride through the dirt paths back to our house. Then I drove home, radioed that I was in position, and waited.

When he'd made it back, he was beaming. He even talked me into dropping him off with Royal to ride back through the dirt trails (not crossing the busy street). He wanted to share the experience with a friend, and Royal was happy to oblige.

I'm so proud of Graham. Not only did he show great attention to road crossings and radio communication, he also demonstrated leadership taking Royal out on his own.
