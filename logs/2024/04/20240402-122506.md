With today's #OCL cohort gathering, I'm just about halfway through #postulancy. I've found it impossible to focus exclusively on a single commitment in a bi-week period, which complicates sharing with the others, but I spoke up more this week on the topic of simplicity in food and clothing.

A question often on my mind as I navigate this process is whether these commitments coincide with long-lasting invitations in my life. Are these topics I will prioritize in community for years to come?
