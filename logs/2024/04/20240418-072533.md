I have been _so_ tired this week. I don't usually drink multiple cups of coffee on a Tuesday. My best guess is that my body is unduly stressed by allergies and is still adapting to the year's allergy medicine schedule. This is also one of my non-stop weeks, where more than half of my lunch "breaks" are used for calls and meetings. Yesterday, not long after my workday ended, I fell asleep until dinnertime.

This is an exhausting week for Amie too. She's up to nine out of twelve scheduled clients, plus another eight meetings. Eight! We hope there won't be many weeks like this where she spends well in excess of a typical 20 hours per week on work.
