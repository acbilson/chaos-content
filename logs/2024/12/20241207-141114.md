Let's do a little recap.

- Thanksgiving was a low-key event at Tom & Deb's house. Amie made carrot soufl√© and her grandma's rolls and I brought hot toddy mix. The boys were especially happy to see their cousin Ty.
- Royal had a third tooth growing above one of his baby teeth, just like his mama. He was put under anethesia and they removed it. Oh, I was so worried for him, but he's handled it remarkably well. They also capped three cavities.
- Amie's work is going well. It's been a wonderful experience working with Optimum Joy again - they embody the professionalism and high standards that're so common in Chicago and almost totally absent in Rapid City.
- Amie's been learning more about schema therapy with an international group of therapists for a few months now. To our happy surprise, she just learned that one of them lives in Lead (but originally from Turkey), not an hour away from us! The chances are astronomically low and we're so curious where this might lead.
- My work is going great. I've received regular accolades and gratitude for my current project and hints of a promotion next year. I'm grateful to be working with Saket, Carrie and Joe. I'd love to get more time with Jace too; we worked briefly on a different project, but it's not likely I'll get back on it with all the current work and I don't see another way to work together right now.
- I've been enjoying the new Factorio Space Age expansion. A lot, perhaps too much. It's one of the best games I've played. I'd only explored two planets before starting over because I'd gotten mentally overextended. With sandbox mode back I've been working on some larger Nauvis blueprints in peace so I can offload some of the mental work of managing a sprawling base and focus on the unique challenges of each planet (and space).
- Graham and Royal discovered Minecraft two weeks ago, and they've been absolutely hooked. I thought Royal would lose interest by now, but that hasn't happened. I'm not surprised that Graham is completely absorbed - he and I are both geared towards architecture and building (he'll _love_ Factorio). I've been surprised how much I've enjoyed playing with them; I knew it could be fun, but it's been the best time I've had in Minecraft since I first tried it years ago. My Raspberry Pi kicked the bucket a few weeks ago, but if/when I replace it I'm strongly considering setting up a Minecraft server for us.
- After a hiatus, Amie and I are reading again at night. We're in the second Harry Potter novel now. Reading with the boys has become a little more sporadic, but they've still read a stack. The most enduring series has been Laura Ingall's "Little House" books.
- Our twice-monthly leader's gathering has been life-giving. I'm so grateful to hang out with this small group of committed leaders on a regular basis, especially when I observe how they've benefiting from our time together also.
