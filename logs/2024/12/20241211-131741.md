Last Monday’s leader’s group was amazing.

First, it’s just wonderful hanging with these friends. Each of them are wonderful in themselves, and together they’re funny and powerful.

Second, we practiced healing prayer. It wasn’t planned, but while we were doing hot-seat prayer the subject of physical healing came up for more than half of us. My favorite part was having the impression that someone’s left hip was hurting. I was tentative, saying “I hope it’s not so, but do you have hip pain?” How surprised I was when it was true and even on the same side I’d been tentative to share!
