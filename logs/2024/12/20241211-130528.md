Amie talked the boys out of the Christmas train this year ($180 is too much for something we only kinda enjoy) and instead offered to stay at a hotel with a pool. So this year weâ€™ll stay down in Custer for a night, swim, eat awesome food, and the drive into the hills to cut down our Christmas tree!
