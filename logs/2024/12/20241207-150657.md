A friend recently joked that we were in the process of planting a Vineyard church in Rapid City. What they'd meant was that we're regularly training leaders to listen for God's voice and the basics of prophetic and healing gifts, but it was though-provoking. Would we deliberately try to plant a church?

Not in the traditional manner. We want so badly to be part of a disciple-making movement that it makes no sense to pursue models which can't replicate without huge financial and leadership investment.
