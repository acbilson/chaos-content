The biggest event on our June calendar was our trip to Puerto Vallarta to celebrate Viktoria's 18th birthday.

The flight from Rapid to Puerto Vallarta was the first in the boy's memory. They've been thrilled about the idea for weeks and were fabulous travelers, even when we had to rush to make our connection flight at DIA.

We had a longer wait to get into our room than anyone expected, so the boys and I went to the beach. Graham and Royal wasted no time jumping into the ocean.

The day before we left, Royal crashed his bike while riding nothing but skivvies. He managed to get scrapes all over his body, blood everywhere. Somehow it didn't keep him from swimming, though it may have influenced how much he spent in the salty ocean.

They days blur together once you arrive. We spent many, many hours in pools all across the resort, and most days at least an hour at the beach. No single place became a favorite swimming hole.

One birthday celebration was a trip to the nearby carnival park. Viktoria and the boys talked me into riding the flower drop AND the ferris wheel. The flower drop takes you up into the sky, then drops you several times. I screamed most of the time, to everyone's amusement.

Another birthday dinner celebration was a six-course meal called Le Pet√Æt Chef. The meal was prepared in front of us by four tiny chefs who appeared on our table via an overhead projector. The food was unbelievable.

Viktoria's final birthday dinner celebration was at an Asian restaurant. The chef prepared the food in front of us like you might experience at a Mongolian Grill. And we got to keep the headbands.

Aunt Steph was the first to get sick, then Viktoria, and Amie on the day of our return.
