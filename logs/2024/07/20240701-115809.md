Some of our more joyful Sabbath celebrations recently have been shared with friends. Before our trip to Puerto Vallarta, Skyler brought over his younger kiddos for an afternoon on the water slide. Last Saturday, Natalie brought Gabe and Luke for an afternoon of building things with wood, nails and screws. We ate crab legs and had a campfire too. This is how we envision Sabbath - the enjoyment of all the good our partnership with the Father has produced, shared in a community of restful gratitude. More of this please!
