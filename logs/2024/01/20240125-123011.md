I'm struggling with feelings of incompetence and humiliation. Nearly two months of wrestling on this tedious and demotivating work project and I couldn't figure out even the basics of what was affecting my capacity to be productive. Twenty minutes explaining myself to one of my colleagues and a difficult conversation with my manager and now my struggle is much more clear. I feel like an incompetent fool and humiliated that, after years of counseling and training I'm still this blind to myself and have grown so little in my awareness of the times I need to seek out help from others. Mercy. ðŸ˜ž
