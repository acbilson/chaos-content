I’m grateful that Amie and I spent a little time last night talking about goals for 2024. We have a few categories that guide our thoughts. Here are some potentials for the list:

1. Love Jesus by spending more time noticing His activity with the Order of the Common Life.
2. Love one another by celebrating our 10th wedding anniversary, maybe with an adventurous trip.
3. Inviting the kingdom of God into our city by meeting for strategic conversations with leaders.
4. Bless our children by fighting all-or-nothing thinking and making our family a safe place to share and confess.
5. Advance Amie’s career by forming her office into a delightful place to see clients.
