Meditating today on some of the injustices which MLK Jr sought to overthrow, I’ve felt ashamed that my whole life hasn’t been swallowed up in the fight as I feel it ought to be for the cause of #justice. In prayer to the Lord I’ve been comforted by the certainty that the Lord’s justice will neither sleep nor be silent. He shall surely judge the nations and their rulers, and not only if I pray and fight hard enough. He will satisfy our hunger for #righteousness.
