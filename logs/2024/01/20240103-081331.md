Christmas was another wonderful, exciting and exhausting day. Well, more like week.

On Christmas morning we opened Christmas stockings with my grandparents.

We left my grandparents to rest and prepare for the afternoon shrimp boil and drove over to Grandpa's house for brunch and gifts.

Then it was back to the house to prepare for the shrimp boil (or as Royal calls them, "shimp". Amie's mom was sick and couldn't be there to help in the morning, or attend the party ðŸ˜¢, so there was a lot to accomplish in a short time.

This year Dan and Judy were able to make it, and we invited our friend Andrew from Westgate. Turns out he grew up with Amie's cousin Elizabeth!

Amie discovered a YouTube channel with party games and replicated one for us to play. Prizes line the sides, hidden in boxes, and you roll an ornament down the center and choose the nearest box to where the ornament stops.

Amie made a hot cocoa sensory bin for the kids. Graham and Royal went around delivering hot cocoa to all the guests.

With so much happening on Christmas day, we opened more of our presents on the day after. And again a few days later after Amie's mom recovered.

Finally, Graham and Royal went to Target to spend their Christmas money on a robotic dinosaur and snake.
