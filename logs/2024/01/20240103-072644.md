My office had become a dumping ground for all the odds-and-ends that float around our home. Yesterday I cleared it out. I'm hoping that decluttering my environment will reduce my stress.

In one corner I have my work desk with the printer on a side table. Beside it is a rectangular space for exercise with 5lb dumbbells and a yoga mat. In the opposite corner I've placed another desk for hobbies and paper filing with a bookshelf next to it. I'd like to hang some art on the walls too; I started with a family picture.
