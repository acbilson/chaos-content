The Order of the Common Life #ocl postulancy began this week and the week prior I began to meet with Westminster staff to discuss chapters of the book “God In My Everything.” We’re getting started by noticing our existing habits and where the Father may be inviting a change.

Skyler demonstrated his #BulletJournal approach to tracking his #RuleOfLife and, inspired, I started a #bujo yesterday. I’m excited to have a system to integrate what I’m learning and doing.
