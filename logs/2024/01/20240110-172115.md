Two days I’ve had lunchtime commitments: #SpiritualDirection and lunch with a friend. In both cases I’ve noticed that the exercise and #meditation that would be slotted into this time gets dropped when it’s replaced. Even if I have some room, I don’t fill it in with these #habits. I’m learning that, even after I've established a rhythm it’s so tied to a time and place that deviation upsets it. That’s okay, there’s tomorrow. Interesting to notice.
