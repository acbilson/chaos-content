Amie, Graham and Royal have been sick for a month. Never in my life have I seen such persistent sickness as I have in the past year. Royal wakes two or three times most nights, Amie coughs and hacks all day long, and Graham is tired and sniffly. Even though I haven’t had symptoms, I’ve been especially tired, probably from fighting it off.

After a failed hearing test we discovered that Royal has had fluid in his ears for months. He’s scheduled to install ear tubes and remove part of his adenoids.
