The days are blurry. This might sound like a bad thing, but I think it's actually good. There haven't been as many crises to punctuate time.

Amie and I celebrated my birthday last week. Besides baking my annual deep-dish apple pie, she got us Broadway tickets for Moulin Rouge.

The show was lovely and absorbing. We're always amazed at the artistry that goes into every Broadway show: the music, the movement, the story and the set were all spectacular.

One of my favorite aspects was the way the writers weaved the movie's music with current rock/pop/love songs. I regularly try to tempt Amie into singing the Elephant Song duet with me, and the way that new hits were weaved in made the entire show familiar and emotionally-connected.
