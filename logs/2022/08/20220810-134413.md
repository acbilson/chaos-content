I've written a longer update about our [Arrival to Rapid City](https://alexbilson.dev/plants/identity/move-to-rapid-city/). It's funny; when I write it down, it doesn't sound that bad. But living through it: the bone-tiredness, the sneezing and aching, the numbing disappointment; our arrival was **terrible**. But I'll forget most of that. That's how memory works.
