Only two weeks in Rapid City and I'm already back to Chicago. Flying into O'Hare still feels like coming home.

David Ello graciously picked me up from the airport and we spent all afternoon chatting on their back porch. Such a joy to hang with David, Sharon and Charlotte.

No travel to Downtown Chicago is complete without going out to eat, and I did enjoy returning to the land of food excellence. But it's not nearly as much fun eating incredible food by myself as when I'm enjoying it together with others. I'd rather eat Papa Murphy's with friends than eat a multi-course meal at a 5-star restaurant.

They're the most human-friendly skyscrapers I've seen, hiding their immensity while gearing the lowest levels to be modernly magnificent." alt="Chicago skyline seen from Holiday Inn at the northwest corner of the Chicago river loop." src="https://images.alexbilson.dev/20220818_115244151_iOS.webp">}}

I feel that I ought to value natural beauty over human-made, but I find them both so captivating in such dramatically different ways that it's impossible to compare." alt="Chicago skyline with bridge." src="https://images.alexbilson.dev/20220818_120142090_iOS.webp">}}
