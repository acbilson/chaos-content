After hearing my story, you decide if you'd like to work with [Xpert Mortgage of Illinois](https://xpertmortgage1.com).

Our condo was under contract with a buyer with a $150k pre-approval through Xpert for three months. First, they wanted "just one more paycheck" from our buyer, so we delayed closing for three weeks. Then they were unresponsive and our lawyer nearly exploded with frustration. After weeks of back-and-forth, our lawyer called the president of the company because she'd never seen such abysmal service. Instead of rectifying the situation, our buyer instead received a loan denial letter claiming that they weren't able to supply $1500. Who even knows where this magic number came from, but both sides, seller and buyer, offered to make up the difference.

This business is not trustworthy. They wasted three months of our time and cost us several thousands of dollars while our condo was under contract with a buyer they'd never loan to. They were not forthcoming about what they needed as a lender and behaved childishly when they made mistakes, all the way up to the president of the company. Their pre-approval cannot be trusted.
