We can come out of COVID quarantine today. I should wear a mask in public but, since I'll be in my office most of the day anyway, this hardly matters. Under these circumstances it's just as painful here as in Evanston, even worse after I factor in the unpacked boxes and dozens of incomplete projects. Hoping things will improve soon now that we're out of quarantine.
