Nolan's [piece about technology](https://nolanlawson.com/2021/08/26/my-love-hate-affair-with-technology/) is like reading my own thoughts, creepy and satisfying to not be the only anti-tech nerd in the world. Amie would say the same thing about the tech in our home (my PiHole blocks most of her email links). I too wonder if fighting this losing battle against technology has any purpose, given that I have to constantly compromise to work and operate in our environment.
