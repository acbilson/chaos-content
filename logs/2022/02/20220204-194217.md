Listening to my colleagues chat about a recent interviewee, I came to a realization about obtaining the 'senior' bit of 'senior software engineer.' Longevity in the domain or breadth of knowledge will never achieve a promotion because 'senior' means someone who is exceptionally well versed at [pick your language or framework]. Sure, a senior needs to have high-quality communication skills, but that won't get them hired if they can't demonstrate an esoteric level of knowledge in [pick your language or framework].

Ah well, guess that's another reason I'm not likely ever to be a senior software developer no matter how many years I devote to it. I can write code in C#, Python, Golang and SQL, with frameworks like Angular/RxJS, React and Flask, but I'm not deeply skilled in any one of these core libraries or frameworks. Where others delve deep into a single stack, I want to compare/contrast between many stacks. So I can be a regular developer almost anywhere, but never a senior.
