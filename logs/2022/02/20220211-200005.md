Our bible study began yesterday so, as one might expect, something unexpected happened.

Amie had just picked up the boys and was walking to the door when her back ceased up in excruciating pain. She just managed to half-drag Royal through the door and make it to our apartment. I was in the middle of a call, but it wasn't crucial and my workday ended there. We carefully hobbled Amie to the bed, gave her some Tylenol and propped her up on pillows to ease the pain.

Three hours later, hearing the boys laughing in our family time, Amie walked over to watch. She was there less than ten seconds before she shouted in pain, surprising both the boys, and hobbled back to bed. Both Royal and Graham came to check on her and give her snuggles. She spent the rest of the evening in bed while I hosted Matt Clampitt (we ended up postponing the bible study in favor of rich conversation). She fell asleep around 10:00; even with the burn from the night's progesterone shot.

The next morning, I picked up an electric hot pad on the way home from dropping off the boys at school. She was able to catch sleep here-and-there until noon, when she was finally able to walk again. If she doesn't twist or bend over, she can manage.

It's merciful this happened just before the weekend, so we should be able to keep her from strenuous activity for a few days while her back recovers. Also merciful that it's muscular pain which, even though there's nothing we can do to mend it faster, can sort itself out without surgery.
