Yesterday was one of the greatest milestones our family has ever achieved. The last remaining fertilized embryo from IVF treatment over three years ago was transferred. In a couple weeks we'll know if it is the LORD's pleasure to bless us with a third child.

In the stillness of faith I rejoice at the thought of a third. At other times I feel anxious, even fearful. Generally, I feel gratitude that soon we'll _never again_ have to work with our IVF clinic. Hallelujah.
