Sick, again.

The school called Amie at 2:00 p.m. to ask if she could pick Royal up early. He hadn't slept over nap time and was wheezing. Royal was agitated in the car and his cough, that horrible, barky croup cough, became so intense that he vomited multiple times on the ride home. Even though it's the fourth time he's had croup, it's never been so violent, and in the middle of the day. Amie dropped Graham at home and took Royal to the doctor (not our pediatrician - they don't take respiratory illnesses. Another clinic).

After two rounds of Albuterol inhaler treatment and a steroid shot, Royal was showing only minimal improvement. The physician recommended Amie take him to the pediatric ER at Advocate Children's Hospital.

When Amie and Royal were settled into a hospital ER room we started figuring out what we would do. Our only car, with both car seats, was at the hospital. To visit Amie, I'd need to find someone to stay with Graham and find a ride to the hospital. I messaged Maya, our upstairs neighbor who has babysat the boys in the past, to see if she could watch Graham on short notice.

Not only did Maya help watch Graham, she and her friend Shawn dropped in before bedtime. I was feeling anxious, and the presence of other adults was helpful. Maya played with Graham and I chit-chatted with Shawn while we waited to learn if Royal would stay overnight in the hospital. Maya also offered her car, so I had a way to get there. May the LORD richly bless Maya and Shawn for their generosity.

I put Graham to bed at 9:00 p.m., hopped in Maya's car, and drove to the hospital with snacks and medicine for Amie. Before I arrived she confirmed that Royal would be staying overnight. As we figured out how I swap out with Amie, I realized my mistake. I should have asked Shawn to drive me over. Then he could take Maya's car back and Amie could drive the car home. So I called Maya (it was now 11:00 p.m.) and asked if they'd do this one last favor. Shawn agreed so, when I arrived, I picked up a couple things for my overnight stay and we headed back to the hospital. Shawn dropped me off, Amie drove the car back, and it was just Royal and I for the night.

It was another hour before a hospital room became available, so Royal slept in the ER for a bit. He was so exhausted that he didn't wake, even when they rolled him through the hallways, up the elevator, and to the room. They gave him another Albuterol treatment and checked his vitals at 1:00 a.m.

A nurse came by at 3:00 a.m. to check Royal and to suck the fluid out of his nose. I held him down for that one - the poor guy was so upset to be woken up and then tortured by a stranger.

At 5:00 a.m. three nurses tried to give Royal an IV that he'd need if the ENT doctor decided to use a scope to check his lungs. Twice they tried the left arm; once in the forearm and once in the hand, but they couldn't get a vein even with the vein-finder machine. Once they tried in the right forearm, then they gave it up. I stayed up until 6:00 a.m. thinking they'd come back with an expert, but it never happened.

The nurse was back at 8:30 to check vitals. That's when I learned that the ENT doctor had decided not to use the scope, so Royal could eat and drink (and he didn't need an IV after all, whew!). I ordered us blueberry pancakes. Royal perked up after snacks and water, so I put his gown, socks and shoes on and we went to explore. He was a hit around the floor, waving at nurses and finding exit signs. He washed his hands at every washing station and introduced himself at every front desk. He finally was too tired to walk, so I carried him back to the room. He and I fell asleep on the couch because he wouldn't let me lay him back in the hospital bed - bad memories.

The ENT doctor finally arrived at 12:30. He scoped Royal down to his vocal cords but didn't find anything amiss. Royal's breathing had steadily improved through the morning, so the doctor gave the all-clear to leave. Amie arrived with Graham shortly thereafter and, at last, we were able to go home.
