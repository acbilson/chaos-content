I was recently gasped at when it was revealed that I contribute to the spread of Jesus' kingdom AND keep full-time employment. Not having a 'full-time' ministry puts me in an unusual category for Americans - the tent-making disciple. This is not unusual elsewhere in the world, where many pastors must work to support their families, but it's expected in America that, if you're like me, you're on staff at a church or parachurch organization. Why am I so unusual?
