My grandparents were in town for my cousin Colby's boot camp graduation at Great Lakes Naval Center. It was great to see them, and especially to introduce Royal to his great-grandfather (Papaw).

While they played with the boys, Amie and I toured the Oak Park Frank Lloyd Wright buildings. The pictures don't do the tour justice, but here are a couple to jog my own memory.
