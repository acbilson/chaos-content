Apologies for the site downtime. I've hosted this site on a Raspberry Pi sitting next to me on my desk for two years, but I'll be shutting the Pi off for our move to Rapid City. That doesn't mean the site will be gone; I _am_ a developer after all!

I've migrated everything to [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com). My Vultr server runs in Chicago, so you probably won't notice the change. If you live on the other side of planet Earth; however, I _could_ deploy a second instance nearer to you. Send me an email and I'll see what I can do :)
