A little late, but on June 25th Amie and I watched Un Ballo In Maschera (A Masked Ball) conducted by [Riccardo Muti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_Muti) with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.

It was magical. Stunning. Breathtaking.

I've not been to many operas but I suspect this one was unusual among them. To watch Muti conduct, feeling each movement's passions: love, fear, anger; is spellbinding. And the opera singers...

I did not until this event realize that a world-class opera singer is gifted, not only with a stellar voice, but also the capacity to act. And what acting! The sly look, the fit of passion; and always planted in place, singing dramatically and synchonously with an entire ochestra.
