Amie's birthday surprise began with a Graeter's ice cream cake, vanilla bean with chocolate. Royal's pick.

Maya, our upstairs neighbor and babysitter for the evening, came down at 6:00, and we were out the door before 6:10. Amie didn't know where we were going, though she had an inkling.

We parked in a private back alley (thanks SpotHero!) and walked down Broadway looking for a dinner spot. Amie chose [Cere's Table](https://g.page/cerestable?share). Delicious.

The food was so good we almost missed our event, the Blue Man Group! We jogged the two blocks to Briar Street Theatre and arrived right at 8:00.

Amie said the show was surprisingly funny and she hadn't expected so much audience participation. The smoke bothered her throat a little, but overall she had a magnificent time. Me too!

Sadly, I didn't take any pictures so here's one of Amie from a few days back.
