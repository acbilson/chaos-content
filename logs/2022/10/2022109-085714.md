There's not been a day like yesterday in some time.

In the morning, Amie, Graham, Royal and I joined a team from Westminster Presbyterian on a hiking trail repair project at Camp Rimrock.

The best part for me was getting to know Skyler a little better. He and his wife moved to Rapid City from Oregon about a year ago. We share some similarities, not least of which is the long-term tension between what's best for the stability and growth of our children (though he's got a few more than we), and our own aspirations as individuals and couples. I can't wait to catch coffee with him soon. May the Spirit of grace sustain his little family and their brand-new-born child.

We dropped in to Grandma Jaynne's home after a short break. She had some wood to stack. I was thinking about why I enjoy it so much. It's like natural therapy. Nothing about it feels like work; it's all enjoyment.

In the evening we had a campfire on our front lawn. Our neighbors came over: Dominic, Kati, Brianna and Jonathan. They've been "just a little" busy - last weekend Dominic and Kati were married! I'm so happy they were able to make it, and that they're doing well. We share a love of board games and a mutual interest in reading the Bible. May we have more opportunities not only to hang out, but also to discover all the riches of God in Christ Jesus together.

I thought that'd be the end of the evening, but while Amie and I were enjoying the fire after Dominic and gang went home, a man walked up and joined us at the fire. His name is Robert. He has an inoperable brain injury that's slowly paralyzing him. He's lost hope and has decided to liquidate all his assets and fly to Ukraine to fight in the Ukrainian Army. I guess he'd rather die fighting. I laid hands on him and prayed that Jesus would heal his brain injury. Nothing happened, except that his headache subsided. Would you pray for Robert, that Jesus would finish the work of healing in his body and hijack his self-destructive plans? I cannot help but think there's purpose in the most random person I could imagine walking up to join our campfire, but also please pray that any schemes of the Enemy would be foiled. Robert isn't in a healthy mental state, and now he knows where we live.
