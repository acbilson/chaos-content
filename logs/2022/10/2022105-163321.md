It's a full week. I had a lovely call with Brad Wathen on Monday and Amie had [MOPS](https://www.mops.org) Tuesday. Tomorrow Royal has his first day at his new "school," then a show-and-tell at Graham's school in the evening. On Friday Amie and I are helping to watch the kids in Graham's classroom so their parents can have a kid-free evening, then on Saturday we're helping to repair a trail near Camp Rimrock. How do we end up with weeks like this? We just keep saying yes to good things. Maybe we need some _great_ things so it's easier to decline the rest...
