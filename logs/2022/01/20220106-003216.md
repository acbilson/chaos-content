My mom returned to Salina a couple days ago. It was great having her, though it seems like it was only a few hours!

Her return flight was canceled just hours before takeoff, but we drove partway there while we verified that it was truly ended. Rather than wait for the airlines to select an alternative, she bought an Amtrak ticket. Amie took her to Union Station in the afternoon and she was traveling the countryside shortly thereafter.

In this season where most in Evanston have drifted into paranoia and fear, it was a happy experience to have my mom and our friends around the table. And the boys especially are blessed to spend time with new people - a rare occurrence these days!
