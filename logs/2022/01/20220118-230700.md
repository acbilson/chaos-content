So, Graham is moving. To a firetruck-red house. With a Christmas tree that we can help decorate. And a big cake with candles so high you need a crane truck to put them on. A giraffe named Lanky is his neighbor. He's going to have a BIG party for all his friends. He sleeps on the roof with his pillow (the tree is on the roof too). And his train set is inside where Royal can't boom it.
