We've had a glorious time sledding and having snowball fights yesterday evening and today.

Yesterday was our first try with the new intertube sled. It worked way better than most I've used, and it was fun to share with Danilo, Andrea, Evan and Nike.

Andrea started the snow fight, and soon there were snowballs flying everywhere. Ok, I may have egged it on a bit. When Amie and Memaw brought Royal out, even he joined in! We were having the best time; one of the greatest snowball fights I've been in.

Today Graham was ready to go start another fight. Two more children about Andrea's age joined in. We ganged up on Danilo, who pulled snow into a sled and got us back.
