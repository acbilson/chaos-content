My mom's here!

Royal and I picked her up from O'Hare yesterday morning around 10:00 a.m. The news has been full of cancelled flights because critical numbers of flight crew are quarantined with the omicron coronavirus variant, so I'm grateful that didn't happen to hers.

The past two weeks have been an exhausted blur as Amie and I have been caring for Royal and Graham in their hand-foot-and-mouth illness. We're less prepared for guests than the last visit, but Amie did a magical job preparing our home while we picked up my mom. The boys are the focal point anyways, and they're absolutely _loving_ my mom. Everything becomes fresh and new when there's a new person to share it with.

The forecast shows 5-to-9 inches of snow today, so it may be a snow-day! Graham will be so excited - our family bought him a sled this year (shhhh, he doesn't know that yet ;) ).
