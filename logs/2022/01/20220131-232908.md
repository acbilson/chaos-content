Yesterday I spent lunch with Dorren, Fareet, Neda, Elias, John and Yen at Pita Inn.

Fareet shared a couple stories I'll try to share here.

## Gary Ministry

Over the course of five months he'd traveled to Gary, IN to purchase cigarettes. Each time he prayed for the vacant buildings on his walk to the gas station.

On one trip the weather was so stormy Fareet could barely see the buildings. He was sad that he couldn't make it to the gas station for his cigarettes, but the Holy Spirit inspired him to ask. So he raised his hands and commanded the storm clouds to part. In less than 30 seconds a corridor of clear sky appeared between the metra stop and the gas station!

Returning home full of joy at Jesus' love for him, Fareet felt compelled to lay his hands on a church with a collapsed roof and prophesy that it would fill with people for the Lord's glory. He felt a sensation like a shockwave, and rejoiced as he continued to the train.

On the train, Fareet saw a 60-year-old woman with bad knees that he'd noticed at the gas station. He asked if she had faith in Jesus' love for her and if he could pray for healing in her knees. She said "yes," and "do it," but her husband was skeptical. Fareet prayed and returned to his seat.

A moment later, the Holy Spirit nudged Fareet to look back at the woman. She was dancing in the walkway like a young girl!

The last time Fareet traveled to Gary, he rejoiced that a repair crew was fixing the church roof.

## Healing Cessation

When Fareet first met Jesus, he was compelled to pray for healing upon finishing the Gospel of Mark. A pastor of a local church learned of his new faith and invited him to join their congregation. Fareet arrived and shared some of the amazing healing stories he'd witnessed. The pastor attempted to tell Fareet that the gift of healing was only for the early apostles.

While the pastor was debating with Fareet, the Holy Spirit said to Fareet, "go pray for that woman with the bent back." Fareet apologized to the pastor for the intrusion, then walked over, asked permission, and laid his hands on the woman's back. She was immediately healed. Fareet returned to the pastor and politely asked him to continue his explanation!

Many thanks to the Lord for His love and presence and healing touch.
