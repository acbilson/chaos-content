I'm full of gratitude for the joyful opportunity to demonstrate Discovery Bible Study (DBS) with folks at Westminster. Invitations like these to partner with others makes the suffering feel light compared to the reward. Am I starting to understand Hebrews 12:1-6 a little? Worth further investigation.

> Father, thank you for inviting me to participate in your Son's kingdom. It's seemed like participation would always be a war of attrition, and I'm grateful for these breakthroughs which have arrived outside my power. Yet "it is for discipline that you have to endure," and I ask for mercy to endure like Jesus did, neither succumbing to the Enemy's hostility nor the inward deception of Sin.

> Form disciples in our neighborhood who, in humility and love, will become servants of all. Make us examples of endurance, love and obedience. Let our holiness be obvious to all but ourselves. Match our desire for your words with a passion for extraordinary prayer. For Jesus' rule!
