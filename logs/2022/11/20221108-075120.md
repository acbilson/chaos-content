I hate this house. If there was any question whether we'd succeeded in cleaning this place, the answer is unequivocally no. Amie's return confirms it.

She was breathing fine in Vancouver and on the drive home. But after just a couple hours in the house, especially in the bedroom, and she was coughing and wheezing.

I don't know where we're going to put our bed, but we need to move it elsewhere so we can tear out the carpet and prime the walls of our bedroom.
