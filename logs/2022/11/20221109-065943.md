Folks with similar interests, like [Ben](https://werd.io), made me aware that [Mastodon is growing fast](https://thespinoff.co.nz/internet/07-11-2022/why-is-everyone-leaving-twitter-for-mastodon). I'd tried it a couple years back, but now that I have an established habit of writing online, I'm thinking of giving it another shot. If they'll have me on the server, you can find me at acbilson@indieweb.social.
