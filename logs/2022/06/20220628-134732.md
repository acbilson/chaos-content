These days are flying by!

The last two weeks I've been totally absorbed in securing a mortgage for our prospective home. Our relationship with the first mortgage broker began well, but when we filled out the loan application we were shocked to find a $9,200 origination fee! The discovery was for the best since it forced me to shop around-a wise practice for any major purchase-but I still wish we'd been able to negotiate with the first broker. Ultimately I went through this process three times and landed on the third broker.

In the midst of loan negotiations we received our home inspection results. While I was ready to give up in my emotionally thin state, the outcome was positive. We're currently negotiating with the sellers about how to handle a couple concerns, and we still have the VA appraisal, but it's a relief that we've made it this far towards moving to Rapid City.
