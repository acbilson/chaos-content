On further reflection, here are thoughts on Baldurâ€™s work.

Notes are a means to an end. A thesis perhaps, or some other concrete project. But also formative, like becoming a person who is skilled at programming, or who can recall and apply historic events. Without an end, notes lose direction. But a note corpus is invaluable for a project as a way both to collect and understand your work. Or in formation, as a means to catalog and reflect on habit formation.
