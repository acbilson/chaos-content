Recently it seems like the happiest bits of our lives, like Graham's birthday or Val and Elda's visit, aren't getting the writing time they deserve. Alas, not much about that is liable to change until this transition's over, but here are a couple pictures.

Graham had a wonderful birthday party last Saturday. He wasn't feeling great and ended up opening presents and staying on the blanket the whole time while all his friends ran about Indian Boundary Park.
