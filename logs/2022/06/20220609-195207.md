I've tinkered with it for a while now, but finally I can show videos on my log!

Because videos are **HUGE**, I've configured them to download only when clicked. Let me know if video makes the site hard to use and I'll take it down.

{{< video src="https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=208B78DFCF965C7A&resid=208B78DFCF965C7A%2131473&authkey=AEDgUNIdAdAEd8c" >}}

This video is Graham and Royal sitting on the window ledge waiting for Mama to come home. They saw a kitty and, later, Royal does a little singing. Enjoy!
