I've tinkered with it for a while now, but finally I can show videos on my log!

Because videos are **HUGE**, I've configured them to download only when clicked. Let me know if video makes the site hard to use and I'll take it down.

This video is Graham and Royal sitting on the window ledge waiting for Mama to come home. They saw a kitty and, later, Royal does a little singing. Enjoy!
