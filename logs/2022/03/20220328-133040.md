Royal's birthday was the most impressive party we've thrown yet. It was hosted at the [Chandler-Newberger Center](https://goo.gl/maps/vAVD4z9FMF3Lxy2n9). They gave us a room with tables and half the gym. The gym was pre-configured with two courses and an instructor showed the kids how to stretch and then how run the course.

For the most part the kids didn't bother to follow a certain path but went to the places that most interested them for the next half-minute. Both Graham and Royal periodically disappeared to get a snack in the other room. After the first hour we moved to the snack room, gorged ourselves on bananas and worms-in-dirt, and watched Royal open gifts. He'd already opened his birthday gifts on his actual birthday - these were just the ones brought by guests and Uncle Mark, Aunt Steph and Viktoria.

There were six children and three times that many adults.
