I've tried three different approaches to fit a board into this doorway, but I can't lay it at the right angle to slip into the existing flooring. It requires a positive 10Â° incline to set, but there's no room under the door jam for that amount of lift. I've ruined a couple boards in the attempt.

I've landed on a final idea: break off the joint and use wood glue to connect the door jam piece to the existing flooring.
