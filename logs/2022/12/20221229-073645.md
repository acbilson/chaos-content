What's going on with lenders?

For the second time in six months a buyer for our condo with a pre-approval letter for 50k more than our asking price was suddenly denied a mortgage at the last stage. I thought maybe the lender was sketchy in the first denial, but the second is a multi-billion-dollar bank.

Our condo is under rental contract, so there is almost zero financial risk for nearly a year, and it's prime Evanston real estate. The whole thing stinks of power abuse.
