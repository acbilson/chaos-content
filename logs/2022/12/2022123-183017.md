It’s the time of year for #NewYearResolutions. But let’s be honest.

- Do I wake up and read the Bible? Listen to a podcast? Meditate? No, I look at my RSS feed. Then email. And now, Mastodon.
- Do I exercise regularly? 30 min a day? No. Some days I don’t walk further than the bed to the kitchen. Sometimes I don’t even step outside.
- Do I eat healthy foods? Cut back on sweets, eat more veges? No. Mostly I eat cereal, Ramen, pizza and PB&J sandwiches.
- Do I get enough sleep? Cut down screen time, rise refreshed? Nope, I stay up late and rise groggy and scattered.

What needs to change? Everything (sigh).

There are many emotions at the end of the year. Today’s emotions? Shame and self-loathing. Ugh, change is hard.
