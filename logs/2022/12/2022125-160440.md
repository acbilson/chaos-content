Enjoyed a conversation with [Aaron Myers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-g-myers-79819826) today. Most of the hour I shared about Amie and my journey with Jesus, but I did get to hear a little about the digital relationships Aaron and team are bridging between Christians and Muslims.

Itâ€™s so encouraging to discover others called by Jesus to international work who live in tiny towns of South Dakota.
