We did it!

Thanks Jaynne's help with setup while we were celebrating with Amie's dad and to the help of Tom and Julie during the event, the largest party we've ever hosted was a roaring success!

We started boiling the potatoes just 30 minutes before we were scheduled to eat. Though it ended up taking 45 minutes, that's not too shabby for a Christmas meal for 20 guests. Amie led everyone through pulling their English Christmas poppers while they waited.

Jaynne brought over a HUGE pot to boil all of this, plus our own pot. It was so full that I had to pull out lemons, corn and water early to make room for the shrimp. My southern ancestors would be proud.

Eating without utensils was a new experience for some, but folks warmed up fast. Some even ate salad and dressing with their hands!

One of our primary goals with this Christmas party was making sure the kids were given special attention. I installed our indoor swing in the basement, and Amie put together Christmas-themed sensory bins. Jaynne created stockings for each of the kids.

After the stockings we opened the White Elephant gifts. Each person was assigned a number, then each picked out a gift or stole a gift from someone else.

I started a fire outside that served as a pit stop on the way to people's cars. Royal and I played a final game of Monster outside with Maddie and Cora.
