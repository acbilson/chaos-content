I’m making good progress defining hikes along the #CentennialTrail for next year. There are perhaps five two-day legs, though I’m not sure about #hiking Bear Butte.

Each leg is in the ~24 mile range. That’s not a rigorous two-day, but some have more elevation changes than others and will be more strenuous.

The next big question is tent accommodations at the mid-way points.

It’ll be fun by myself, but even better if those I’m inviting do a leg with me!
