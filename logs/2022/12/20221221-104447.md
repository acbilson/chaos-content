We cut down our Christmas tree last weekend!

There weren't nearly enough lights in our bin for such a massive tree, so Amie picked up five boxes at discount. But they only had one plug each!

With Jaynne's help we got the lights on the behemoth. Since we couldn't string them together without a plug on each end, we went with a vertical alignment.
