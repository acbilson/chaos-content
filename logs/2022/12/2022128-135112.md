So thankful for my manager (Mike Hartmann) and the rest of the IT leadership at Performance Trust. A friend of Amie's mom is a contractor and we learned last-minute that he could come by with his table saw tomorrow afternoon to help me lay flooring in our bedroom.

Needed to take a half-day, approved to take a half-day. 🙏🏻
