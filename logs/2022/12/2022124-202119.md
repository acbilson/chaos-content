This week I overworked and under-rested. As a natural result, my weekend has been pessimistic, critical and overly analytical.

I am grateful for the reset that comes from attending a church service. I can remember again that I am in a cosmic story, that the Author is kinder than I am, and that I am not alone.

So let us (again) throw off the weight of foolish shame and run with endurance the race set before us. I give you my weakness, King Jesus, and you carry my burdens. To infinity, and beyond!
