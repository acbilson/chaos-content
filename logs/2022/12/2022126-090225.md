I’ve missed memorizing larger chunks of the #Bible. Haven’t done any new stories or passages for years. Thinking this will be the year for a new attempt.

The largest segments I’ve memorized are the Sermon on the Mount, Romans 1-8, most of Ephesians, and 31 proverbs. Don’t quiz me though-it’s been many years.

“I’m torn between a section of the #Torah and the scroll of Hebrews. Who wants to join me?
