Random thought: in both the Exodus story and Jesus' resurrection there was a defeat of the spirit powers; the gods of Egypt and the prince of this world. Jesus' victory changes no geopolitical boundaries and produces no visible earthly dominion, but it is on analogy with Israel's flight from Egypt as the ultimate redemption from oppression.

One implication of this news is that the invisible powers are the truest enslavers and root source of humanity's failure to live as image bearers (not that we bear no responsibility, but as those who are coerced, not "free agents").

If this is true, then I would expect a developing conflict between the LORD and the Canaanite gods who, rather than present themselves to Israel as an innoculous alternative, like chicken or beef, are actively luring Israel into covenant unfaithfulness. Jesus' victory then would be in part, not only to defeat an internal human bent but, perhaps even more significantly, bind the suitor that threatens his relationship to the bride.

Is this visible in the Story?
