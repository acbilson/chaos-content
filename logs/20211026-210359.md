Amie's back! Graham, Royal and I picked her up after school yesterday. The flight was delayed by weather so we ended up circling the airport for a bit. Graham slept through it and Royal was only mildly agitated.

Amie had a fabulous time in Maine. I won't spoil her stories, but you should ask her about the time Olivia gave her a "treatment."

Amie brought home special lobster suckers. Royal enjoyed his a lot...
