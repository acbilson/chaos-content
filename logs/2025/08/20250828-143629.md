Amie and I finished “Catcher in the Rye” last night. I never would have made it through to the end without Amie’s encouragement!

For most of the book I thought, “wow, I guess this is a classic because it’s colloquial? Definitely not because it’s interesting!” I wouldn’t have caught the twist on the last page if Amie hadn’t pointed it out. And just like that, a terrible book becomes a thought-provoking novel. Impressive!

I don’t recommend it per se, but there are some who will enjoy the masterful grasp on the interior dialog of depression.
