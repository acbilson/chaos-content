Amie and I took a blitz trip to Denver for a Regina Spektor concert. What happened in Denver far exceeds the swift turnaround, however.

We visited Matthew, Michelle, Tommy, Jaq and Hezekiah. We didn’t drive back to our hotel until 0200! Besides abundant laughter and catching up, we also discovered that Matthew and Michelle are facilitating a DBS group and actively starting more. It was a surreal experience to have DBS pitched to us, since we’ve been the advocates for the past 12 years.

The concert was far beyond my hopes. Regina started by reciting Mr. Rogers’ song about liking you just the way you are. She played a wide selection of her work (all of which I’ve memorized by now) and I discovered so much more about her art and perspective by hearing her in person. Amie said it best - her child-like freedom and playfulness is beautiful and so spiritually deep.

The boys stayed home and went camping with Grandma. They had an ecstatic time playing, swimming, eating, and rodeoing,
