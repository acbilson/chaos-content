I have big news. I’m applying for a doctoral program at Denver Seminary!

To be more specific, I’ve applied for a [Doctor of Ministry in New Missional Movements](https://denverseminary.edu/program/doctor-of-ministry-in-new-missional-movements/).

I have three reasons to go this route. 

First, I’ve known for a few years I have the acumen and motivation for doctoral research. I’d read Umberto Eco’s seminal work on the topic, _How To Write a Thesis_, a few years ago and have been pondering thesis ideas ever since. As a man, a father and a model, I feel it’s imperative to go as far as I am capable with the time and ability given me.

Second, I’ve been a practitioner in the disciple-making movement space for over twelve years. In this time, my commitment to the principles and confidence of its relevance for the Church in the USA has only burned hotter. I want to do my part to push the legitimacy of DMM for our context, and adding my doctoral thesis to the subject of modern movements is a powerful way to do so.

Third, I anticipate that further influence among church leaders requires more evidence of my expertise than my résumé. A doctoral thesis in my subject has the greatest chance to open more doors and minds in my middle years.
