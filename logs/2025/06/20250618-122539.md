We’re in prep mode for our trip to De Smet and Sioux Falls. We still need sufficient snacks and meals for the first two days, and there’s some packing to do, but our general itinerary is set. I’m not feeling particularly eager about the trip at the moment; mostly because we’ve just begun that time of year when my allergies ambush me mercilessly.
