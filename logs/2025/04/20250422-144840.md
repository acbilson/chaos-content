My mom (or Memaw to the boys) stayed with us over Spring Break!

Between my work schedule and Amie's, my mom spent most of the first three days just with Graham and Royal. It's hard even to remember in the whirlwind, although there was lots of laughter on the other side of my office door.

Thursday we set out for the Badlands. Although it was chilly (and later snowed), we were glad that we went. We stopped at the historic Wall Drug on the way home to pick up some souvenirs.

My mom's United flight was cancelled on Friday so she was able to stay through Saturday morning. It turned out great since we hadn't had a chance to go fishing yet! Although we didn't catch anything (hard to do at 11:00 in the afternoon) I was happy we didn't miss that opportunity.
