I've been reading the Silverlight Archive series by Brandon Sanderson. I'm on his latest, Wind & Truth. While working on our garden this evening while the boys were with Amie doing "quiet time" before bed, I finally put language to one of my favorite parts of Sanderson's writing. His characters experience immense external stress and even greater internal anguish from their various mental ailments (acute depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, multiple-personality disorder, and Asperger's to name a few), but following their lives over the course of multiple books gives the reader a chance to observe them mature through their struggles. This, in turn, invites personal reflection on the ways that I've matured through the course of my life also which offers hope for future growth.
