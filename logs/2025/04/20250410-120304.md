Amie's going on a Caribbean cruise!

We were hoping to set up a girl's trip with Laura Doo this summer. They tossed ideas back-and-forth for a few weeks, narrowing down their requirements, until it became clear that three points were crucial: 1) it must be cost-effective, and 2) it must be all-inclusive, 3) it must be less than a week. Turns out there's not much that fits all three categories.
