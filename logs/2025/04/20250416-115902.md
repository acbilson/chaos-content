My mom’s visiting over the boy’s Sprung Break. She flew in Monday morning and returns to Kansas Friday afternoon.

The first half of the visit is a whirlwind. I have the last two days off of work, but these first three are full days. Amie will be working Thursday, so that’s the first time that I’ll be 100% around. We’re considering a trip to the Bad Lands.
