I've been reading Jerome Berryman's "Godly Play: An Imaginative Approach to Religious Education." It was lent to me by Natalie as a resource for figuring out how to teach our boys about the Bible. I'm going to need to transfer my notes to a plant page at some point; there's so much here to think about. My two favorite parts about this recommendation is that it grows from a Montessori teaching model (which fits Graham's educational journey) and it thinks deeply about early childhood formation.

I've been impressed by this description of the Creative Process. Though I can't figure out quite where Mr. Berryman's got it from, it matches with the implicit process of a well-facilitated DBS group.

1. Opening to wonder. Can be hard (tragedy) or soft (curiosity).
2. Scanning. The dissonance between current frame of meaning and a discovery while wondering. Pre-language.
3. Insight. Put the feelings and mental shift into words and images.
4. Articulation. Communicate the insight to others for validation and feedback.
5. Closure.
