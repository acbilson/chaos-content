I've agreed to join a summer DnD campaign with my neighbor Dominic Cossi and his family! I've been surprised how much I've enjoyed thinking up a backstory for my character (modeled after an amalgamation of characters in Stormlight Archives). I'm thinking this'll be a good outlet for my budding interest in amateur acting, he he.
