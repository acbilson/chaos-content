Graham, Royal and I visited a local bike shop to explore buying a new bike for Graham. I’d thought to just explore and purchase later, but Graham took so well to this Specialized bike that we walked away with it.

I’ve been so proud of Graham’s persistence in practicing gear shifting and handlebar brakes and his generous spirit and encouragement for Royal, and proud of Royal’s lack of jealousy towards Graham and his tenacity in practicing to pedal Graham’s blue Strider bike (which was a _much_ harder transition for Graham than gears and brakes have been).
