Today I had a joyful time discussing Amie and I's goals and desires for our boy's spiritual formation with a couple leaders at Westminster. Ostensibly under the auspice of consulting on the topic of youth ministry, our conversation ranged longer on the subjects of a parent's responsibility for their children's spiritual development (and associated guilt), the different needs of various age groups, the effect of trauma on relational connection with Jesus, and the pitfalls of hypocrisy. I came hoping to offer some support as a consultant by listening well and clarifying purpose, but I walked away receiving support and encouragement (and three borrowed books!).
