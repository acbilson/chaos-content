Royal woke with croup at 11:00 last night. After trying the usual moist/cold air combo it was clear he wasn’t going to be sleeping. He’d vomited his dinner and was struggling to draw breath. So I drove him to the ER.

The staff at the ER were very helpful, but it’s always a long process. After three hours we’d gotten him an epinephrine nebulizer and a dose of Prednisone with a prescription for more. We were home by 2:30 this morning.

I started work an hour late and left an hour early, but somehow still managed to get some work done. Now I’m filling Royal’s prescription and then we’ll have a movie night. Excited to watch Mufasa again!
