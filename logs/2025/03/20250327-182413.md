It’d been so long since I’d written anything on the log that I didn’t realize that my publishing system was broken. It’s really set up to only go one year at a time without manual intervention. Maybe I should fix that…

I’m having a bit of a freeze. What do I write about? I mean, the purpose of this is to post life updates but I’m not even sure what to say. There is so much going on, and at the same time nothing that’s really that exciting. I guess I really want to have something remarkable to report. It’s funny because I still haven’t published anything about our trip to Italy.
