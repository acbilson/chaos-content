My reading for this Chicago trip has been Isabel Wilkerson's _Caste: The Origins of our Discontents_. Not only ought the subject matter be required reading for any American or American-to-be; her writing is exceptional. She addresses some of the most horrific elements of American history with candor while developing empathy for _both_ ends of the caste system. It's taken me a few months to start reading this book because of anticipated grief, anger and despair. Yet Wilkerson has crafted a work so great that it pulls no punches yet doesn't leave one in a puddle on the floor.
