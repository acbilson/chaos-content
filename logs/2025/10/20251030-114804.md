I've been in Chicago this week at the Performance Trust Fall event. The IT department has been running a hackathon. My contribution on the team was developing a trial MCP server to integrate database access into potential LLM agents. It's pretty cool when it works.

I've also discovered that Anthropic, the makers of Claude, have defined a bunch of [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/connect-local-servers) which can be run on one's computer to grant access to local files for the LLM. When I'm back on my own machine, I'd like to see if I could get it to consume the original Markdown files that comprise this site.
