Graham caught an enormous rainbow trout fishing off the bridge at Paktola reservoir yesterday morning. It was beyond his fishing poleâ€™s ability to reel in, but we drew the fish over to the bank and I was able to get it into our bucket from there. Graham and Royal are both definitively catch-and-release, so we returned it right after the photo.
