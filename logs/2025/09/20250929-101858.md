Graham is _loving_ school. So much he can’t sleep at night because he’s so excited to be at school again the next day. He’s making new friends, is over-the-moon about his new writing journal, and has begun violin lessons.

Royal’s confidence at school has been growing. Like Graham before him, his 5 1/2 year old year switched something in his brain. Whereas last year he didn’t care to do lessons, now he’s excited about progressing through the red boxes so he can start on the yellow. He’s also making new friends and getting into less trouble.
