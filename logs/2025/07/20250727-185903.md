Since my last log we’ve all been to Chicago for a week and to Rimrock Family Camp. It’s not felt overly hectic, and somehow we’ve avoided obvious illness (astounding!), but full enough that I’ve only just began to look past the next three days. We have one more trip next weekend - a Regina Spektor concert - and then the summer activities are, I think, wrapped up.
