Amie had an endoscopy today because she'd had trouble choking awhile back. When the doctor was looking around, however, the doctor didn't find the customary scarring, just some swelling, and so didn't do anything. They took a biopsy, but otherwise that's it. Amie's been hurting the rest of the evening from bloating caused by the anesthesia. You don't know till you know, you know?
