# Privacy Policy

I have zero ways to track anyone who visits my site, and no means for anyone to enter content except myself. Only my own privacy is at stake.

# Data Policy

My site is like a brick-and-mortar library. As the curator, I decide what books are on my shelf whether I've written the content or not. I do offer the works of other authors and will not modify their content without permission. But I might take it off the shelf.

I've also begun a small index of some of my favorite webmasters. If anyone is listed on my index and wishes to be forgotten, simply email me at acbilson (at) ofchaosandorder (dot) com and I'll remove all traces.
