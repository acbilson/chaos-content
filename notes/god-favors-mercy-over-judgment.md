Even in the midst of judgment the LORD shows mercy to individuals who repent. Joshua's conquest begins with the story of a Canaanite woman, Rahab, who's faith gave Israel courage and delivered, not only her own life, but the life of her father, mother, and all her siblings (see {{< backref src="/bible/rahab-preserves-israelite-spies" >}}). This stands in juxtaposition to the Canaanite kings who, upon hearing of Israel's military victories, banned together to destroy them. Perhaps the authors begin the book of Joshua with Rahab's story to make it clear that, while the land of Canaan may have become as corrupt as Noah's generation, the LORD's mercy is available for anyone who seeks Him, just as He was for Noah.
