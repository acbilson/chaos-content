- Define composite notes and leaf notes. A common practice in Obsidian is to append "MOC" (Maps Of Content) to a composite note. Andy uses the 'ยง' symbol. I could also add it to the front matter and filter them into a separate list.

> For the moment, the language of the note's title is sufficient. A noun-based note like "Angular Maxims" distinguishes it as a MOC while a verb note like "Favor Identifier Over Index" indicates a leaf.

- Determine my promotion-to-post guidelines. Some of my notes equal my posts in quality, length, and completeness. How to decide when a note about programming becomes an insight post?

> I think the only differentiation is that posts are what I share. I don't like sharing notes because I want to keep them more malleable. It's for this same reason that I don't backlink notes from posts. So I promote to a post when there's something I want to share. Perhaps a lesser reason to post is that it cuts down on the list of notes, but that really hasn't happened.

- Figure out what kind of process would be helpful to review notes for further thinking. If these are primarily to help me innovate through aggregating and networking thought, it would be helpful to periodically _look_ at the whole corpus.

> I had my first noticable success with this by reviewing notes and creating a couple MOCs from common themes. I discovered some business writing which had direct relevance to church forms.
