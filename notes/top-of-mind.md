- Write a response to, or at least a note from, Ed's article, [The Church of American Startups and Capitalism](https://ez.substack.com/p/the-church-of-american-startups-and?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNzcwMDksInBvc3RfaWQiOjM4NTc1OTQ1LCJfIjoiRE03eE8iLCJpYXQiOjE2MjU5NDAyMTEsImV4cCI6MTYyNTk0MzgxMSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTg5ODIiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.IwdqfJ8jjXMovesXeA071SNE9yHvwRypZC5hRN8aFQE)

- Write a response to Rosano's post [Six Guns Pointed at my Face](https://rosano.hmm.garden/01f6srp7b67f2pe06bk7dqk9y1)

- Write note about Codex Vitae [Doomhammer Codex](https://garden.doomhammer.info/codex-vitae-f35d7e)

- Write a note from one of the pages on formilab [Formilab](https://fourmilab.ch)

- Learn more about _ikigai_, or "a reason for being" [Polymath Playbook](https://salman.io/blog/polymath-playbook/)

- Add ðŸŒ± ðŸŒ¿ ðŸª´  (seedling, sprout, potted plant) before notes to indicate their publication maturity. There's both epistemic (i.e. how confident I am) and complete, but I think one symbol is sufficient to represent both for now.

- Define composite notes and leaf notes. A common practice in Obsidian is to append "MOC" to a composite note. Andy uses the 'Â§' symbol. I could also add it to the front matter and filter them into a separate list.

- Determine my promotion-to-post guidelines. Some of my notes equal my posts in quality, length, and completeness. How to decide when a note about programming becomes an insight post?

- Revise evangelism paradigm notes, there's a lot of cruft.
