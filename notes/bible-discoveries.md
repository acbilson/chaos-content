In hopes that themes will emerge and understanding deepen, here is all the content from discoveries I've made in the Bible.

### Idol creation and worship was forbidden because _we're_ God's icons.

{{< backref src="/notes/catholic-devotion-to-the-blessed-virgin" >}} has this reality in mind when it elevates Mary's godliness.

### Biblical sacrifice isn't only about cost

A better {{< backref src="/notes/definition-of-biblical-sacrifice" >}} is so helpful when thinking about the relationship between the Old Testament sacrifices and references to sacrifice in the New Testament.

### The Bible is a composition of real kinds of literature as they are found elsewhere

- {{< backref src="/notes/epistles-are-real-correspondence" >}}

### The Bible is not at odds with macro-evolution

> Caveat: this is a work-in-progress, and my thoughts on this topic change regularly. I have found this exploration has led to new insights like {{< backref src="/notes/genetic-repair-in-the-new-creation" >}}

### The Sabbath is a _delight_

This comes both from the Bible and from personal experience. It's a constant iteration to keep the Sabbath well so, stealing the word "remix" from Isabella Burton, I've got a {{< backref src="/notes/keep-the-sabbath-remix" >}}.

### Is the marriage covenant like God's, reaching to many generations?

Less of a discovery and more of an open question, is it true that the {{< backref src="/notes/marriage-covenant-extends-many-generations" >}}?

### Tithes should go first to the Levite

Most money goes to fund other things than the people who serve in what we'd call "fulltime ministry." This might be a mistake since the {{< backref src="/notes/tithe-goes-to-the-levites" >}}

It may be worth exploring Paul's collection for the Jerusalem saints. If my understanding of priesthood is correct, the New Testament standard returns us to the "kingdom of priests" that the LORD describes to Moses, the image of God realized. Among other things, it would mean that every believer qualifies as a Levite, which would further generalize tithes from their current model, a kind of church-building-replaces-temple situation, to a shared pool for everyone. Hmmm, isn't that what Acts 2 describes?

### There are numerous views on the Bible and its composition

Who knew there were so many, but the way you view the Bible has a dramatic affect on what you expect from it. See {{< backref src="/notes/ways-to-define-the-bible" >}}

### All biblical roles and gifts are expressions of the Imago Dei

- {{< backref src="/notes/all-biblical-roles-and-gifts-express-imago-dei" >}}

### Jesus fulfills the Imago Dei in surprising ways

- {{< backref src="/notes/jesus-fulfills-the-roles-and-gifts" >}}

### Jesus' Word Brings Life

# Research in John 5

In the story where {{< backref src="/stones/bible/jesus-heals-a-crippled-man-near-the-sheep-gate" >}}, Jesus uses His relationship with the Father as the basis for numerous arguments.

- Jesus performs miracles because the Father loves him and shows him what he's doing (implied, that the Father performs miracles with/through Jesus)
- The Father leaves all judgment to Jesus because the Father wants him to receive equal honor.
- The crippled man was healed because the Father has given Jesus life in himself in the same way that the Father has life in himself.

Jesus sees a crippled man. He takes note that this man has been waiting many years for healing (implication: his faith has grown very weak from deferred hope). He decides to offer life to the crippled man, the same life that the Father has made to dwell in himself. The Father alone supplies life, but he grants Jesus the full rights to decide so that Jesus will receive equal honor when the crippled man is made well. The Father's mission and Jesus' are the same, so Jesus can say that the Father shows him this work to do and at the same time Jesus decides to do it.

### God loves humans and wants many more of us, trouble though we may be

{{< backref src="/notes/god-wants-more-humans" >}}

### The Bible is for both wisdom and pleasure

{{< backref src="/notes/the-bible-is-for-wisdom-and-pleasure" >}}

### God promises that humans, rather than direct intervention, will be the means of retribution after the Flood

{{< backref src="/notes/god-promises-humans-deliver-retribution" >}}

### God is slow to bring judgement but swift to execute it when the time is fulfilled

{{< backref src="/notes/god-is-slow-to-judge-but-swift-to-execute" >}}

### God rescues individuals who repent, even in the midst of judgment
