In hopes that themes will emerge and understanding deepen, here is all the content from discoveries I've made in the Bible.

### Idol creation and worship was forbidden because _we're_ God's icons.

{{< backref "catholic-devotion-to-the-blessed-virgin" >}} has this reality in mind when it elevates Mary's godliness.

### Biblical sacrifice isn't primarily about cost

A better {{< backref "/notes/definition-of-biblical-sacrifice" >}} is so helpful when thinking about the relationship between the Old Testament sacrifices and references to sacrifice in the New Testament.

### The Bible is a composition of real kinds of literature as they are found elsewhere

### The Sabbath is a _delight_

This comes both from the Bible and from personal experience. It's a constant iteration to keep the Sabbath well so, stealing the word "remix" from Isabella Burton, I've got a {{< backref "/notes/keep-the-sabbath-remix" >}}.

Most money goes to fund other things than the people who serve in what we'd call "fulltime ministry." This might be a mistake since the {{< backref "/notes/tithe-goes-to-the-levites" >}}

### There are numerous views on the Bible and its composition

Who knew there were so many, but the way you view the Bible has a dramatic affect on what you expect from it. See {{< backref "/notes/ways-to-define-the-bible" >}}
