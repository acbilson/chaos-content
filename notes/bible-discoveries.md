In hopes that themes will emerge and understanding deepen, here is all the content from discoveries I've made in the Bible.

### Idol creation and worship was forbidden because _we're_ God's icons.

{{< backref src="catholic-devotion-to-the-blessed-virgin" >}} has this reality in mind when it elevates Mary's godliness.

### Biblical sacrifice isn't only about cost

A better {{< backref src="/notes/definition-of-biblical-sacrifice" >}} is so helpful when thinking about the relationship between the Old Testament sacrifices and references to sacrifice in the New Testament.

### The Bible is a composition of real kinds of literature as they are found elsewhere

- {{< backref src="epistles-are-real-correspondence" >}}

### The Bible is not at odds with macro-evolution

> Caveat: this is a work-in-progress, and my thoughts on this topic change regularly. I have found this exploration has led to new insights like {{< backref src="/notes/genetic-repair-in-the-new-creation" >}}

### The Sabbath is a _delight_

This comes both from the Bible and from personal experience. It's a constant iteration to keep the Sabbath well so, stealing the word "remix" from Isabella Burton, I've got a {{< backref src="/notes/keep-the-sabbath-remix" >}}.

### Is the marriage covenant like God's, reaching to many generations?

Less of a discovery and more of an open question, is it true that the {{< backref src="/notes/marriage-covenant-extends-many-generations" >}}?

### Tithes should go first to the Levite

Most money goes to fund other things than the people who serve in what we'd call "fulltime ministry." This might be a mistake since the {{< backref src="/notes/tithe-goes-to-the-levites" >}}

It may be worth exploring Paul's collection for the Jerusalem saints. If my understanding of priesthood is correct, the New Testament standard returns us to the "kingdom of priests" that the LORD describes to Moses, the image of God realized. Among other things, it would mean that every believer qualifies as a Levite, which would further generalize tithes from their current model, a kind of church-building-replaces-temple situation, to a shared pool for everyone. Hmmm, isn't that what Acts 2 describes?

### There are numerous views on the Bible and its composition

Who knew there were so many, but the way you view the Bible has a dramatic affect on what you expect from it. See {{< backref src="/notes/ways-to-define-the-bible" >}}

### All biblical roles and gifts are expressions of the Imago Dei

- {{< backref src="/notes/all-biblical-roles-and-gifts-express-imago-dei" >}}

### Jesus fulfills the Imago Dei in surprising ways

- {{< backref src="/notes/jesus-fulfills-the-roles-and-gifts" >}}

### Jesus' Word Brings Life

TODO: create one MOC each for light, life, and judgment

In the story where {{< backref src="/bible/jesus-heals-a-crippled-man-near-the-sheep-gate" >}}, Jesus uses His relationship with the Father as the basis for numerous arguments.

- Jesus performs miracles because the Father loves him and shows him what he's doing (implied, that the Father performs miracles with/through Jesus)
- The Father leaves all judgment to Jesus because the Father wants him to receive equal honor.
- The crippled man was healed because the Father has given Jesus life in himself in the same way that the Father has life in himself.

Jesus sees a crippled man. He takes note that this man has been waiting many years for healing (implication: his faith has grown very weak from deferred hope). He decides to offer life to the crippled man, the same life that the Father has made to dwell in himself. The Father alone supplies life, but he grants Jesus the full rights to decide so that Jesus will receive equal honor when the crippled man is made well. The Father's mission and Jesus' are the same, so Jesus can say that the Father shows him this work to do and at the same time Jesus decides to do it.

There's a complex thread of ideas around light, judgment, and life from the beginning of John's Gospel to the end.

The first use of the word 'judgment' is in John 3:19, when the author says that people's rejection of the light that has entered the world is their judgment.

Then in John 5:22-24 Jesus says that the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son so that people honor him equally. The Father also shares His own life-giving essence with the Son. When people hear his word and believes the Father who sent him, the receive life and are free from judgment.

Later, in John 8:16, Jesus says that he does not judge alone, but he judges together with the Father who sent him. He starts the paragraph claiming to be the light that has entered the world, and addresses the witness just as in John 5.

I wonder if light, judgment, and life are intertwined because each refers to a design pattern around the Imago Dei?

Light is a pattern that begins with the first page in Genesis in reference, first to spiritual beings (and by implication, the one God), but later to humans acting as image bearers (see Moses' glowing face and the high priest's white garb). Light applies to all humans, to be sons of light, lights of the world, etc.

Life if another pattern that begins in Genesis with the tree of life. Humans are mapped onto trees throughout the Bible, sometimes as trees of life (that is, those who transfer God's own life) and also trees of knowing good and bad. Life is closely connected with light, such that Jesus can say that he is the light of life (John 8:12), probably because life emminates from the source of life, Yahweh.

If both light and life are intertwined, then there's a strong possibility that judgment also is connected. However, I don't know where judgment might fit into the Genesis narrative except by implication. In the center of garden within Eden, God places the tree of life and the tree of knowing good and bad. If it's true that defining good and bad on our own terms (the tree of knowing good and bad) leads to death, but trusting God to define what is good brings life (the tree of life), then good judgment would be listening to God's voice in acts of trust. Jesus' judgment, because he listens to the Father and does only that which the Father shows him, would by definition be good judgment because it's based, not on his own terms, but on his trustful listening. In this way, all his brothers are likewise called to have true judgment by turning away from defining good and bad on our own terms and listening to the Spirit.
