I may need to rethink the types of content on my site. It began as an outlet for business and parenting, with traditional blog posts. I've added a hodge podge of other writings in this comments section.

I'll probably keep the blog posts. Articles are effective ways to distill an idea or write about an event. Comments might be split into three.

- life updates
- bookmarks
- ideas/notes

Life updates are a journal I enjoy reviewing, and a way for family to catch up on our lives. These can be condensed into a single timeline.

Bookmarks are for links to other's writing. I'm not sure that it needs a separate section because links almost always have context with an idea I'm writing about.

Ideas/notes are what makes up my digital garden. These might later be encapsulated in blog posts, or they may remain as notes. Ideally, they would be mostly [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C).
