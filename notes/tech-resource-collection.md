There are so many new links from this weekend that I saved them for just one (long) comment:

There are so many build tools but, at the base level, `make` rocks. I love the [self-documented example](https://victoria.dev/blog/how-to-create-a-self-documenting-makefile/) Victoria shares.

I want to try some of these recommendations from Victoria: [technical ergonomics](https://victoria.dev/blog/technical-ergonomics-for-the-efficient-developer/)

Brian Linkletter’s [content](http://www.brianlinkletter.com/) may be a few years old, but his insight into network emulation is unparalleled.

Maybe someday I’ll work with Black Hills Information Security. Until then, thanks for the [advice](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Uv-AfK7PkxU) for entering the InfoSec field.

[imagemagick](http://www.brianlinkletter.com/process-images-for-your-blog-with-imagemagick/#more-4257) might be how I could speed the image loads on my site *and* make local image storage imaginable.

There are so many gems on [Command Line Kung Fu](http://blog.commandlinekungfu.com/search?updated-max=2009-03-04T05:00:00-05:00&max-results=7&start=173&by-date=false&m=1). I’ve read almost every post!

The [OneDrive API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/?view=odsp-graph-online) could finally make it possible to post images in my on-the-go comments. Specifically this endpoint: [createLink](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/developer/rest-api/api/driveitem_createlink?view=odsp-graph-online).

I want to read this through this lengthy post again: [It’s time to get personal](https://24ways.org/2019/its-time-to-get-personal/).
