While reflecting on one of the Psalms, I thought, "Wow, this song is so generic; I'm not getting _anything_ out of it." Then I noticed in the textual notes that the Psalm and the one to follow were an acrostic, and the Holy Spirit reminded me of a verse out of Genesis. God's words both supply nourishment _and_ delight.

And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food.
