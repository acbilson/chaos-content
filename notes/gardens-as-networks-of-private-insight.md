Andy's site, referred to as "working notes", construct a "thinking environment" that Andy uses to generate his own content [About these notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes). He does encorporate external resources, but these are secondary to his own writing and typically consist of links rather than unique objects. Subjects are explores in sections, marked with a 'ยง'.

The way Andy organizes these into collections is by section (or MOC). The relationships become a network, not by accidental inclusion into the same tag group, but by deliberate referencing and backreferencing. If you wish to see a collection, you must find the overarching MOC, or MOCs, of which that content is a part. Navigation-wise, this is by clicking links, but a network diagram _could_ be generated and spokes identified.

Andy's site, in contrast to {{< backref src="/notes/gardens-as-museums-of-others-content" >}}, informs the reader equally about his favorite subjects and about the mind of Andy himself.

## Reflection

My site's purpose is more closely aligned with this approach because I favor content creation over collection. The limitation to this approach, however, is that it limits the context of my writing to the direct source I ascribe any one idea (or multiple if I pull together the various quotes). For example, I may have a business note which references Maxwell's leadership book. If I wanted to further explore the context of my insight, re-reading the book is my option. However, if that book is included in a collection of leadership books, then I could further develop the insight by perusing any of the leadership books in the collection, even books which I might not have considered relevant to the note's topic.
