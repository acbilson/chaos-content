Evangelism approaches (see [[Directory of Evangelistic Approaches]]) answer differently the question, "Who am I trying to talk to?" If generalized, there are two buckets:

- Shotgun evangelism (tracts, street preaching, door-to-door, big tent revival)
- Network evangelism (friendship evangelism)

Where they share the same goal, however, is in answer to the question, "Who am I looking for?" For any evangelistic approach, the answer is always the individual (rarely, the group) who will give the evangelist an audience. Mature evangelists might discriminate by the audience's interest to save time.

The limitation in our culture's individualistic approach is that it ignores two axioms: {{< backref "/notes/lone-converts-are-a-liability" "Lone Converts Are a Liability" >}} and {{< "/notes/allegiance-to-jesus-is-communal" "Allegiance to Jesus is Communal" >}}.
