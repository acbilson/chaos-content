I've thought more about the structure of my site, and what's developing hardens back to my original post on {{< backref "/posts/resources/purpose" >}}

The first category is writing for myself. This will comprise a collection of notes and a series of articles.

Articles are compositions of an idea, possibly linking to several notes, and will be publicly available. They will not be static, however, but will include both a published date and a last edited date. Most of my posts to date for this category.

Notes are loose-form and I'll attempt to make them evergreen. They might be a link to another site, a note that bridges two articles, or anything else that crops up as my digital exploration continues.

The second category is writing for my children. This has expanded to family, but I still think my children will get the most out of it. These will comprise two types: stories and logs.

Stories are similar to articles in composition but have a different focus. They will share details about events in our present and past, with pictures and videos when available. Some of my posts fit this category.

Logs are snippets of what we're doing in the present. They provide a running answer to the question, "what have you been up to recently?"

These two sections will have distinct spaces.

Logs will be in timeline format. Stories will be included in the timeline, though I'm not sure how that'll work if I include stories from years back.

Articles will be in a list by category like they are on my home page today. The publication date may be de-emphasized. Notes will only be navigable through bi-directional links, though I may keep tags as a way to discover connections, and both notes and articles should be viewed by tag.
