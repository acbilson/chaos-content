# Value Proposition Alternatives

The Construction Site makes technical business interactions between U.S. and Omani companies successful by framing the business representative's visit with on-site cultural mentorship and preventative health measures.  The local community is reinforced with short-term trauma assistance and employment opportunities for part-time local business owners.

### Ad-Lib #1: Our preventative health packages helps U.S.-based business representatives who've traveled to Oman for stays longer than two weeks who want to remain mentally, spiritually, and emotionally healthy by smoothing the effects of culture shock and clarifying communication between them and their sending company.

- This is an intriguing idea because direct contact with the on-site business representatives allows us to personalize our service and establish ties with companies.  There are clear ways to be spiritually open and profitable while delivering a useful service.

### Ad-Lib #2: Our on-site crisis counseling helps U.S.-based business representatives who've traveled to Oman who want to receive immediate emotional and mental assistance with a recent tragedy back at home by de-escalating fear and fight-or-flight behavior and supporting the initial processing of the event in between business negotiations.

- This type of support will make an impact in people's lives because their lives are already being impacted by a recent tragedy.  I'm not thrilled about the dependence upon tragedy for a viable business, so this may be a side-service.

### Ad-Lib #3: Our on-site cultural mentoring helps U.S.-based technology business representatives who want to achieve lasting partnerships with Omani businesses by explaining cultural mistakes and supplying sound Oman-specific business advice from local part-time business people, unlike other cultural training services that are not specific to Oman or supply Omani business mentors.

- If Oman actually did become a technology hub-who knows, maybe it will?-this service would explode overnight.  The connection with Omani business people excites me because the opportunity to employ local people and the unique value proposition are intertwined.

### Ad-Lib #4: Our counseling program helps expats who want to travel overseas as business representatives but fear that personal mental illness disqualifies them by giving them the opportunity to transition existing counseling access to Oman and delivering excellent care from people who experience the same overseas challenges, unlike the counselor they've seen in their home country.

- Statistics indicate one in four people suffer from mental illness, which makes this a valuable and useful service for more people than probably recognize it.  This makes for a sustainable practice, more so than others that rely on specific events to trigger service, and the clients are already familiar with the service from prior exposure.

### Ad-Lib #5: Our short-term trauma counseling helps refugee families in the local community who want to overcome debilitating behavioral abnormalities caused by recent traumas by teaching effective interventions and offering paths to further healing and a better quality of life.

- This one is actually the social part of the business, not necessarily the profitable side.  We're excited to have a social component of the business from the get-go, no matter how small, and want it to be weaved into the business identity early on.
