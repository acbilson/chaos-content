It's been a thought-provoking day. I guess it comes from reading "Adam and the Genome" by Dennis Venema and Scot McKnight at 4:00 a.m. while letting Royal sleep on my chest. Here's a couple to revisit.

- What if the righting of the world in Jesus' return is related to genetic repair? If present in our DNA are the fragments of our ancestors, and some ancestors enjoy features which we have since lost, what would humanity be like if all or most positive features were transfused into a single body? What if a human had the smell of a bloodhound, the hearing of a dolphin, and the vision of an octopus?

- What if Jesus' anger at religious authorities was not primarily that they were teaching false information, but that the outcome of their flawed teaching was an unjust society? What if Jesus cared more about the shape of society than theological accuracy, but recognized that one flows into the other?
