How does one launch a {{<acronym DMM "Disciple-Making Movement">}}? Or a {{<acronym MDM "Movement of Disciple-Making">}}? Well, I don't know the answer to that, but this is our approach.

First, apparently it starts with seven years of failed attempts. Not gonna get into this, but we've been seeking this for the entirety of our time in Chicago, seven years, and perhaps am only beginning to see the idea spread.

Second, form a cadre of like-minded followers.

Third, engage in extraordinary prayer and fasting.
