There's not an official definition for the term, "digital garden," but the best overview of the concept is Maggie Appleton's [History of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). You might also glean insight into the differences between a digital garden and a blog by reviewing Shawn's [Digital Garden Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos/), or by Tom Critchlow's analysis of three forms of digital communication in [Streams, Campfires and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/).

# Content Concepts

Implementations of the digital garden concept vary widely, but among the most cohesive I've found two that serve as useful representations.

- {{< backref src="/notes/gardens-as-networks-of-private-insight" >}}

# Content Growth

Digital gardens use the imagery of a garden to explore the maturity level of the garden's content. As a plant can begin a seed, grow into a sprout, and mature to a flower that itself bears seeds, so can an idea or concept that's encapsulated in one's content. This analogy assists content creators to differentiate their work among various classifications, such as its polish, their certainty of its reliability, or the breadth of humanity for which it may be applicable. An exploration into the digital garden must, by this analogy, also delve into the ways that plants arrive in the garden and how they are classified.

There are two core classifications, fluid and stable. A digital gardener must, even if it's never classified on their site, {{< backref src="/notes/define-fluid-and-stable-content" >}}.

# A New Analogy

Riffing off Tom's streams metaphor, let's borrow the analogy of a boats sailing in a bay to explore the formation of a digital garden.

> It's probable that the garden analogy could be expanded to fit, but I was a sailor so there ya have it. When I think of a garden, I think of a small plot of land with a few flowers and vegetables. If you use the Queen of England's gardens for an analogy, now you've got a lot more room to _grow_.

A digital garden is like a boat-filled bay fed by many streams. Each stream has it's inlet where it joins the bay. The bay has limited physical barriers to the ocean beyond, so most boats that float down the streams join with the ocean. Some boats, however, stay within the bay.

The streams that feed into the bay are data streams. A Twitter timeline might feed into the garden, or an RSS feed. For the sake of simplicity, even reading a book or watching a movie would qualify since digital gardens aren't aggregations of data, their external representations of an individual's thought (#MORE_HERE). Let's not lose sight that a garden is curated by humans, not mass-produced by bots, while we try out this alternative analogy.

The boats floating in the stream are cohesive units of content. Every person has their own threshold for which boats put up anchor in the harbor, but generally only a fraction of all boats are worthy of inclusion, like a few quotes from a book vis-Ã -vis the entire volume.

Inclusion does not equate to value. I may write journal entries to share the latest family updates with my family and friends. Just because it's mostly excluded doesn't make it drivel. And some of those updates are raw material for family stories that may be filled out and planted in my garden.

# A New Site Vision

> These are rough, unorganized notes as I attempt to figure out how this applies to my own website. The best content is above.

I'm tossing around a few tweaks to my own site after exploring the digital garden / digital bay concepts.

![Site Design Wire Frames](https://bn02pap001files.storage.live.com/y4mYl9__E7DIJPiaRvoOfotn1CLFm3kZ3XJ1CIRPuJsdG4puB1r5naOTVqmZKafR6YxcrtMgkSpWhnxxvfQRIicpYpxLdgZgOiKmyBIpGEhOdY3m5wgLAbjCPCHnn_73HgzXuAMI2jVxJwzkcZyI57ts-_rMz040M7Z1g5ZXImHVVtPgsLcPAYkXTMoCTaAhXsq?width=768&height=1024&cropmode=none)

For my site, I _do_ want everything to flow into my own garden, no other tools required. Since my fluid content and my stable content are within the same system a clear definition of the two types can be explicitly filtered into boats (fluid) and rocks/plants (stable).

## Log

A log is a fluid, chronological journal entry about me or my family. This content is displayed in the river as a boat. It's not included in other views, but can be clicked to open an individual log entry.

## Quip

A quip is a fluid, non-chronological entry that collects some idea or piece of content. It might be a flash of inspiration, a bookmark, a quote, etc. The content itself is all that's important; it does not require anything more than a timestamp. It will show up in the river as a boat of a different color/style.

## Plant

A plant is a stable entry of personal content. It might contain references to other's content, but it's core purpose is to encapsulate a gardener's personal thought. It is a Quip that's been expanded to include context and structure, such as a title or references. It's an organic entity that is open to further growth or pruning, but it has moved from the temporariness of the fluid boat to a place on the land.

## Stone

A stone is a stable entry of other's content. It encorporates full attribution to the original creator but, since it's not under the creator's control, is unlikely to change.

### Bay View

TODO: Continue here

I'd love to have an iconic bay view that shows everyting from a 10,000 foot perspective. All the tributaries can be seen, like small ribbons leading into the bay. Small islands will be shown. The whole picture will have an ancient map feel. Entries that have recently been added to a tributary would be shown as a little boat floating towards the bay islands. Each of the tributaries or islands will be clickable.

When clicked, the view will zoom to that tributary/island. The view may be slightly different depending on its content. For example, the log tributary (based on ship's log) will show the Story Island at the top and entries floating towards it in little boats.

If I click an island, it will zoom to a second-level view where the island takes up the screen. Island features will be labelled and clickable. For example, on Story Island, "Poetry Point" would be written along a prominent outlook. On Treasure Island, a "Quote Quay" might be available to click.

These views are two-fold. First, they give the viewer a sense of continuity amonst all the content while illustrating the differences between each. Sailboats are moving towards a destination, not static, while content on "Poetry Point" might be subject to revision but not removal. Second, they help organize the flow of information such that I will more easily be able to organize the entry and dissemination of information.

Everything in this view will be a type. Broadly, there are two types: standing rocks (on the island) and fluid boats (in the tributaries). But the content in "Quote Quay" will be only quotes.

This is the high-level overview display, but it is siloed in a way. Poetry will belong to "Poetry Point", but a poem about work that might be referenced by an article on Treasure Island has no way to display that link. And so the next view is born.

### Treasures and Plants

This view is about connection, therefore content that's in the tributaries drops off. Connection can be produced in two ways: by reference and by tag. These will be interchangable in some way.

Treasure is gathered from an external, static, source. A quote from a favorite book is an example of a treasure. These are not subject to change and contribute, but do not form, my own content. They are emminently referencable material, but they don't 'grow'.

Plants, by contrast, are growing, changing, personal content. An insight about the nature of humans is an example of a plant. The insight may be supported by treasures, such as a quote from the Bible or a digital article, but it is an insight which I have written about and may edit, delete, or refute.

### Tag View

The tag view will match something like Nick's commonbook. What's crucial is that the tag/author (or space/creator) is easy to reference and peruse. A count per would be helpful, just like his site. Unlike his site; however, there will be at least two kinds of content: treasure and plant.

I will use the tag view to explore concepts. For example, like Nick's site I may want to review everything I've learned/gathered about work. A link to 'work 5|0' indicates there are five treasures and zero plants in this category (a good candidate for personal reflection). If I click the link, I will be shown a screen/panel/something which might include a quote, a piece of poetry, a story, etc. These would belong on different islands, but here they are together. I don't know if I also want creators like Nick has - I am already separating mine/not mine, which may be enough?

### Reference View

The reference view will be a network diagram. It will show, at telescopic levels (like Obsidian), what content links to and is linked by. A plant, a MOC, may be called "Design Patterns" and have three plant notes and two treasure nodes that it refers to. The plant nodes will have backrefs to the MOC, but of course the treasures are external and will not. On this view also these two types, plant and treasure, must be visibly different.

Both plants and treasures may have node names that are descriptors, e.g. "Design Patterns", or action statements, e.g. "Choose Leaders Wisely." Therefore they have to show some designation which makes them appear different, whether by color or icon or something else.

I will use this view to explore connections and missing insights. For example, I may find a hub node which shares a single child node with another hub. This node connection is worth exploring to see if there are other similarities between the two hubs.

## Building Blocks

This is an enormous undertaking. How can I break it down?

For a v1, I have some pieces already. chaos-micropub gives me the ability to create logs anywhere (awesome). Notes are a bit more limited since I _must_ enter a name, so perhaps I need another boat-style fluid entry that I could use which doesn't produce something in the log stream OR the notes (like a draft?).

Rocks exist in the form of posts and notes for plants, but a treasure type must be added. Posts/notes would need to be re-envisioned to form a single new type, a plant, but how to chop it up is not known at this time. For example, is it best to have a system that separates plants into types, e.g. plant/story? What other ways, like epistemic, lastmod, etc, can be used to filter and display them? Should plants and treasures be in separate directories, like /plant and /treasure, or should it be by type, e.g. poetry/plant, poetry/treasure, or even just /poetry with differing metadata? It's at this point I'd rather move to sqlite...

Another question set is, should one system contain both boats and rocks? Should the input stuff flow in one system, and rocks be stored in another? Like boats being chaos-micropub and rocks being chaos-wiki? Oh the questions...

One way around the folder structure might be to use stubs. I could incorporate any level of foldering without having to worry about it affecting the high-level routing. For example, I could have plants and statues in separate folders for writing/editing organization, but have them hosted at the same route. Same with logs and unnamed notes.

/log
/quip
/plant
/stone

Instead of posts and notes, there will be only plants and stones. The post page will become a mature plant, so that any note which reaches maturity is discoverable.

### Type: Log

The log type will suffer the least change. It will remain in timeline format, but with an interesting boat-style theme floating towards Bilson Bay. These may be promoted to stories at some point, which would put them in the plant type.

### Type: Quip

This type doesn't exist today. Like the Log type, it will have no title. It is by nature ephemeral, meant only to house thoughts and ideas in-flight for later addition as plants or stones. It's possible that this type might be skipped if the creation of plants and stones were simple (worth considering). Alternatively, it could be a plant/stone with draft = True so it doesn't show up.

### Type: Plant

This type matches the note type today. However, it also comprises the post type. The difference between the two will be only its growth and epistemic level. A newly-formed plant is likely to have a low epistemic level, perhaps 'hypothesis', and an early growth value, probably 'seedling'. A plant which belongs on the Home page, the Island if you will, has at least a growth value of 'plant'. Epistemic level may also play a factor. In this way plants are separated into different places on my website. See epistemic ideas [here](http://evantravers.com/articles/2021/10/25/nurturing-notes-and-thoughts/)

### Type: Stone

This type has no correlative today. It comprises any content, whether it's a quote, a story, a design, etc. which I do not possess. It cannot grow because it's a snapshot of another's work. I'm not sure yet whether this type requires an epistemic value, but it should have a longevity value, I'm thinking "fresh", "worn", "mossy". Perhaps this _does_ incorporate the epistemic value, for it assumes that the time-worn holds more weight. Alternatively, there value could be calculated from the creation date: fresh being 0-3 months from creation, worn being 4-12 months, mossy being over a year. The purpose of having this value, like the growth value for plants, is to divide stones into two distinct places: on the island and off. Those stones which make it "on the island" are crucial to the formation of my ideas and life, while those not yet on the island are being tried out for veracity and usefulness.
