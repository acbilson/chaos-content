Aral Balkan [summarizes](https://ar.al/2021/05/10/hell-site/) what I've discovered myself after years in technology and business - the prevailing system for generating software in the last decade or so is engineered to create human-oppressing products. As with many of the systemic problems of our society, those with the power to change the system are also those who profit most. The likelihood of real change in the natural order is nil; prayer is essential.
