You're ready to write, but not sure how to start? This is how I'll help you get started.

# Write

Here are a few writing obstacles you don't need to worry about.

- Don't let the medium distract you from your writing purpose. Record audio snippets, write in a bound journal, stencil papyrus sheets, it doesn't matter. Anything can be moved into digital ink.

- Don't try to fit your writing into a prescribed box. Your writing can be shaped into any form imaginable - blog, book, diagram, twitter feed, etc., but the form can wait. The longest writing I've ever completed was a 100-page thesis, the shortest was a recent comment.

- Don't stress about distribution. One of the reasons to write in your own digital space is that you can share it anywhere. Tools exist to share automatically, like posting a blurb on Facebook or a link to Twitter. Or both.

- Don't stress about perfection. Another reason to write in your own digital space is that you can add/delete anything you want, whenever you want.

# Find inspiration

One of my goals this year has been to publish something every month, and it's been a great help to read other's writings. You can see where I've been helped by reading the thanks for my favorite independent writers here. You may already have this figured out, in which case I'd love to see your list of inspiration!

# Pick a domain name

This is where people go to see your site. For example, mine is 'alexbilson', but 'oforderandchaos' was on the table too. I chose my name because the site serves as a digital resume of sorts, but it doesn't have to be your name. To figure out what's available, go here and search for a few ideas. A domain name costs ~$15/year.

# Select a writing platform

This part is overwhelming because there are infinite options, each with its pros/cons. You don't need to worry about any of the buzzwords and catchphrases - all you need is a place to put text, and maybe a few pictures, onto a website with some semblance of order. If you'd prefer, I can explain all of your options, in detail, with pros/cons.

I suggest WordPress.com. Look at their themes to get an idea of how your site might look. I like this one, but I'm a minimalist (as you can probably tell from my site). Your writing is the star of the show, so don't spend too much time pondering how it's encased. Themes can be swapped out if you want a visual change. The personal package suits your needs and costs $48/year.

No matter where your writing lives, I recommend keeping a final draft of everything you write. Store it in Dropbox or another place that gets backed up. When you're itching to customize your website beyond what Wordpress.com can offer, having easy access to all your original content will smooth the transition.
