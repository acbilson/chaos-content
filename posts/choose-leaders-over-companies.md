You may have heard the adage, "people leave managers, not businesses." If this is true, what does it mean for your next job?

At the beginning of my career I believed, if I honed my skills and lengthened my resume, eventually I'd be hired at one of the star tech companies of my generation. A career in tech was like a staircase to the roof - if I climbed enough steps I'd arrive at the top.

Instead of slowly climbing until I reached a dream company, I started at the top. Relativity was (is?) the leader in its industry, with the culture and perks to rival any Google startup. In five years, the gratitude I felt to work at such a vibrant, energizing company never waned. If I'd reached tech nirvana, why'd I leave?

The short answer is, I didn't want to leave. I tried with all my might to stay. But finally, at imminent risk of being fired, I left.

The first two years I had no aspirations. Dazzled by the glamor of high-speed tech and privileged just to be there, I spent my energy proving I wasn't an imposter.

TODO: (transition to TBA, lost interest and family struggles, ).

So, dear reader, look for a great leader first, and don't worry so much about at which company he/she works.
