# Landscape

The CMS landscape spans from the feature-packed, plugin-manic heavy-weights like Wordpress, Drupal, and Wix, through the up-and-coming middle-weights like Ghost and Craft, and into the light-weight contestants like Forestry.io and Netlify CMS.

## Heavy-weights

The heavy-weights claim to be for the non-technical. And yes, I don't have to read a single line of code to launch a Wordpress site. But wow, it's overwhelming to get started.

Since I started my first Wordpress site back in 2010, the software has added dozens of new features. It's clear that a consultant could build a career building and optimizing Wordpress sites. What it lacks in simplicity, however, it makes up in plugin diversity. While I don't have a specific use-case in mind, the plugin ecosystem is so expansive that it's hard to imagine a component I'd want that's not available (so long as I'm willing to pay).

## Middle-weights

I've taken Ghost for a short spin, and it's the most enjoyable to use CMS I've touched. The writing interface is attractive and uncluttered, and I love that it has spell check. You do pay for it though; an out-of-the-box Ghost setup costs more than any other option on the list.
