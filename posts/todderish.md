Todderish, or the language of toddlers, may share words from other tongues, but it remains a stubbornly unique language in any host culture.

English-influenced Todderish steals several words. “No,” “mine,” and “more” being some of the most recognizable. Here are a few you may not recognize.

yak. Verb. kick, smack. “yak ball!”
gook. Verb. To cut. “Gook da beekie!”
poot. Verb. To fart. “papa poot”
nonk. Noun. honk. “Truck ‘Nonk, Nonk!’”
wheesh. Noun. wheel, tire. “Da truck’s wheeshes.”
beesh. Noun. beach. “Go beesh?”
num-nuh. Noun. Cat. “Num-nuh ‘meow’”
wa-wa. Noun. Water. “more wa-wa”
eitch. Noun. Light. “No eitch.”
diis. Noun. This. “I want diis!”
beekie. Noun. Bacon. “More beekie!”
deesh. Noun. Dirt. “I got the deesh”
look. Noun. Crane. “where da look?”

Todderish has no conjunctions but, to communicate with languages that do, it adds mimicry filler phrases.

dib-i-dat. Conjunction. “dib-i-dat wheesh”
tika-tika-tika. Conjunction. “tika-tika-tika ball!”
gikida. Conjunction. “gikida maan.”
gida-gida. Conjunction. “gida-gida truck.”
