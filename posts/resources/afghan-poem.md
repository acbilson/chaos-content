After my deployment to Afghanistan in the U.S. Navy, I had a lot to process. Poetry was the result.

> My interpretation of what happened in Afghanistan has deepened since I wrote this poetry. Don't assume you understand my current theology because you've found misunderstanding in a poem I penned in 2011.

<h3>Beginning</h3>

<p>
Swift sailing through the sea of life
Weather diverse but He is near
Spirit close calms every fear
</p>

<p>
Waves crash vain upon my bow
Shall circumstances rock my hold
Upon the Lord of grace foretold?
</p>

<p>
Nay, victory is mine through Christ
Almighty conqueror of death
The world’s released its bated breath
</p>

<h3>Trickery</h3>

<p>
The worse is past now no more work
I think I’ll take some time to rest
Comfort seems to me the best
</p>

<p>
Lay my head on Ease’s lap
Complacency bids me to sleep
“Hush now, there’s no watch to keep”
</p>

<p>
Cool breeze lulls my eyes to droop
Dreams of glory, honor, power
Only I, man of the hour
</p>

<h3>Withdrawal</h3>

<p>
Self-exalted, basement fails
Structure crumbles with a crash
Wood and stubble turn to ash
</p>

<p>
(Respite reveals the heart of man
When labor turns to selfish ease
Corrupt affections to appease)
</p>

<p>
Wake in dread, the sails have stilled
Windless, caught without a breeze
Trapped within the glassy seas
</p>

<p>
Face of God has turned away,
Temptation raises banner high
Without help I’ll surely die
</p>

<h3>Lament</h3>

<p>
Empty thoughts devoid of light
Stretch the hold to nearly burst
Abundant water, always thirst
</p>

<p>
Now my daily sustenance
Leaves me empty, incomplete
Tasteless is the Godly meat
</p>

<p>
What my soul had once refused
Worldly bread I once had known
In my stomach turns to stone
</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<p>
Accusations fill my lips
Questions swirl within my head
Am I counted as the dead?
</p>

<p>
Is my strength akin to stones?
Does my flesh consist of brass?
Are not all my days as grass?
</p>

<p>
Do I have an arm like God?
Present at the start of time?
Creator each after their kind?
</p>

<h3>Help?</h3>

<p>
I’ve no strength cannot progress
Fate hinges on holy wind
Word speaks, “He must condescend”
</p>

<p>
Spirit of the Living God
I have no handle on Thee
Hope only on Your mercy
</p>

<p>
I can’t draw the love of God
No bucket, and the well is deep
Within Joseph’s well to sleep
</p>

<h3>Repentance</h3>

<p>
Who am I to complain thus?
My iniquity ascends
Far above lofty heavens
</p>

<p>
I was raised in countless sins
Every day I add the cost
To Jesus’ flesh upon the cross
</p>

<p>
My just lot is death in hell
If were not for His mercy
As He hung upon the tree
</p>

<h3>Resolved</h3>

<p>
If I know not Christ in God
There is nowhere else to turn
I shall seek Jesus - or burn
</p>

<p>
Am I not Thy purchased prize?
Make me so despite my life
Thou art greater than all strife
</p>

<p>
You deserve my every breath
Poured out for Your endless praise
Even if my soul won’t raise
</p>

<p>
To life endless in Your love
Under Thy judgment I must
Say, “Lord all you speak is just”
</p>

<h3>Return</h3>

<p>
Humility floods through my soul
Limbs splayed out upon the deck
Nothing left now to protect
</p>

<p>
Honesty pours grimly forth
From a heart without a pulse
The hull begins to convulse
</p>

<p>
What is this! slips from my mouth
Sails snap to my great surprise
I can feel the breeze arise!
</p>

<h3>Exultation</h3>

<p>
God has heard my desperate prayer
Healing on His outspread wings
Mercy great my heart now sings!
</p>

<p>
Restored at the foot of Christ
Heart leaps in renewed delight
Jesus, Jesus fills my sight!
</p>

<p>
Knowing what it means to feel
Separated from the Lord
Leaving twice I can’t afford
</p>

<p>
Strive to walk in holy fear
Truly this is the start of
Wisdom, knowledge from above
</p>

<h3>Advance</h3>

<p>
In your Spirit daily march
Mortifying flesh by grace
Gazing always on Your face
</p>

<p>
Jesus take the conning wheel
Steer the ship as you see fit
Riding into bright sunset
</p>

<p>
Where lie the celestial shores
Promised to fathers of old
To their sons continually told
</p>

<h3>Longing</h3>

<p>
When I reach the crystal shore
Leaping from the soggy planks
I’ll join Your people on the banks
</p>

<p>
Of Jordan where the faithful cross
To meet our Husband in the air
The virgin bride, His love all fair
</p>

<p>
Sing grateful hallelujahs
To the Lamb upon the throne
Oh, I can’t wait to be home!
</p>
