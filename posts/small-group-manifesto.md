How does Jesus' Kingdom community organize? Is the Sunday gathering primary? What are 'micro' groups? These are the sort of questions that keep me up into the wee hours of the morning. Will you join me in an exercise to loosely structure a Kingdom community?

When you consider how a church community might orient on a given week, at least four options exist:

- Sunday gatherings
- discipleship groups
- special interest groups
- friendship groups


These four exist in tension, like rubber bands that pull the community toward a center. A community that entirely lacks one of these bands may still suspend, but it means that the other bands must exert greater tension to stay centered. Remove two and the community may suspend off-center; three and it dangles in the air.

I chose the manifesto format from my experience with the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), because a manifesto seeks to describe distinctives rather than definitions. By choosing distinctives over definitions, I allow the bands to stretch and contract to fit the cultural and circumstantial needs of the location in which the Kingdom community lives. At the same time I give room for communities missing one or more of these bands to exist as true Kingdom communities, albeit -over-stretched bands.

> This list correlates with distinctives of spiritual formation because Jesus' Kingdom community is the **primary** mechanism for formation.

# Friendship

**Synonyms:** &bull; micro groups &bull; accountability partners &bull; teams

**Biblical examples:**

- Jesus, Peter, James, and John
- Paul, Silas, Timothy
- David and Jonathan

## Intimacy over comfort

There are few moments more powerful than when one shares one’s darkest secrets with another human being and receives compassion. Some transformation will not proceed without intimacy.

## Comraderie over diversity

Shared experience in a common mission binds people together and cements their commitment to one another through suffering.

### Summary

Individual growth in the fundamental qualities of a Christian, qualities such as obedience, humility, and compassion, has many hindrances. Trauma, loneliness, spiritual attack, and a lack of self-awareness are a few reasons we don't develop deeper humility, comprehensive obedience, or genuine compassion. Close friendships, where individuals are welcome to encourage and confront one another from an intimate, confidential relationship, is a powerful means of character growth. Micro groups, whether it be formally named or not, is about two to four people who move towards total commitment to one another, complete transparency, and a unified mission.

# Special Interest

**Synonyms:** &bull; skill training &bull; topical teaching

**Biblical examples:**

- Paul, Pricilla and Aquilla

## Instruction over community

Yada yada

### Summary

# Discipleship

**Synonyms:** &bull; discovery bible studies (DBS)

**Biblical examples:**

- The twelve apostles
- House churches in Paul’s letters
- David’s mighty men

## Obedience over knowledge

DMC’s put the Bible's claims, instructions, and demands before participants and inspire them to wrestle out how to respond together. They enable participants to interact with other's perspectives, ideas, and backgrounds through the shared experience of reading the Bible. Participants should not end at knowledge but take what's been discovered and apply it to their lives.

## Contribution over consensus

Small groups are centers of diversity. It's less important that everyone agree than it is that everyone participate.

## Discovery over instruction

Small groups facilitate every member to discover the Bible's claims for themselves. All participants grant space for others to learn at their own pace.

## Innovation over conformity

Small groups package core principles in new models that engage their community. Exploration and risk-taking is encouraged.

## Multiplication over addition

Small groups replicate by inviting newcomers to launch their own groups with people in their networks over commitment to an existing group.

## Coaching over centralization

Small group facilitators are coached by facilitators from another group. Loose central control is encouraged.

### Summary

This is where most transformation happens at the corporate level and it is the vehicle for community transformation. Groups of diverse people who engage God's words to discover his commands and character, to confront human nature, and to apply these discoveries to one's life is what moves people to make disciples of all nations. Highly reproducible, small groups can be constituted of Christians only, of Christians and not-yet-Christians, or entirely of non-Christians. While services such as Financial Peace University offer timely instruction for a subset of community and community gatherings around subjects other than the Bible may form micro groups, small groups are inherently Bible-oriented. This is because the combination of the Bible, the gifts of Christian participants, and the Holy Spirit's leading is the most powerful means of discipleship available.

# Sunday gathering

**Synonyms:** &bull; celebration &bull; huddle &bull; conference

**Biblical examples:**

- Synagogue
- Paul’s lectures in Ephesus
- Jesus’ sermon on the mount

## Exposure over uniformity

Church services expose participants to a broad range of people, gifts, and teaching - the diversity of the Church and her gifts. Exposure to a range of spiritual gifts and Christian theology is preferred over a short and orderly service.

## Celebration over discovery

Church services gather many in one purpose: to love Jesus and their neighbors. The opportunity to celebrate with one another is more valuable because it is rare.

### Summary

Community life benefits tremendously when the roles and gifts of all Christians are expressed and shared. Teachers with sound theological instruction protect the Church from heresy and build up its faith, hope, and love, prophesy encourages and guides the community through challenges and into opportunities, administration organizes large functions where mutual sharing and group service can be expressed. Without Sunday gatherings, Jesus Communities remain scattered collections of Christians with a loosely cohesive mission; with Sunday gatherings, the community reminds itself of its shared and unified purpose and labor in the world.
