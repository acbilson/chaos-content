What I'm about to share with you makes me extremely uncomfortable.

I am apostolically gifted. (cringe) Let me explain.

My deepest desire is to form communities of people who love Jesus and do what he says in places where these communities don't exist yet.

Spreading the good news about Jesus is important to me, but I'm not an evangelist. I resonate with the evangelist's hunger to witness and disappointment at the Church's weak outreach, but my communal view of Jesus communities keeps me fighting to light a fire in the church instead of running to the streets.

Sharing the riches of the Bible is close to my heart, but I'm not a teacher. I am passionate about quality hermeneutics and fight tooth-and-nail against heretical doctrine, but my eyes are always roaming to the people who need to learn that Jesus is trustworthy before I teach them substitutionary atonement or the essential need for cultural context.

Caring for the hearts and bodies of my community, especially the weak and injured, is vital to me, but I'm not a pastor. My entire being is drawn towards the hurting and vulnerable, but I can't keep my gaze from wandering to the next street, wondering if the vulnerable there have a loving Jesus community yet.

Why do I cringe?

Applying the word 'apostle' to myself makes me cringe because I think it's like putting a mantle of authority I have not earned onto my shoulders, or to sit down at the same table with Peter, Paul, and Junia and claim to be their equals. But my journey has led me to a different conclusion, even though that one lingers.

In the last couple years I've been coming to terms with the way I'm geared. I have an unswerving ambition to influence the world towards Jesus, but I've noticed that the way many achieve influence is expertise. My nature vies against any hope of expertise, because I simply can't commit myself to only one subject. If it takes 10,000 hours to become an expert in one subject, I'll be an expert in twenty things sometime when I'm eighty years old. Which means that I'm never going to be the best at anything.

When I consider the role of an apostle, however, I realize that it's crucial to be a broad amateur. To plant communities of Jesus followers, it's important that all gifts operate in healthy ways to build up the community. It's not my role to take the teacher's position in an established church, but I should equip a new teaching-gifted disciple with the basics so that they can go on to be an effective teacher in their community. I shouldn't be the evangelist, but I should be able to model what it looks like to share Jesus with others and help an evangelist remain tethered to the church. I ought not be the pastor, but I should encourage the pastorally-gifted to fulfill their charge with honor. I'm the board member, not a member of the C suite.

The truth is, I'm the least of all the church. I can teach, but I sound like a novice compared to a teacher. I can share, but it's hard to notice next to an evangelist. I care deeply for the community, but my love looks cold compared to a pastor. I fit nowhere, but spend my time everywhere.
