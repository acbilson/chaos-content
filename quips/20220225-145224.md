A few ideas for chaos-chat.

Use SignalR to push updates to the current chat room. See [SignalR with Blazor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/tutorials/signalr-blazor?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio&pivots=server).

Share a DbContext instance per user among all page components for performance and collision reasons. Could still use a service layer, just DI the context. See [Blazor and EFCore](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/blazor-server-ef-core?view=aspnetcore-6.0).

Use `dotnet publish` with a specific architecture and version to make the production executable smaller. See [dotnet publish](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-publish).

Use the .NET Core Identity project to include authentication. Can modify from there to make it more restrictive. See [.NET Core Identity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio).
