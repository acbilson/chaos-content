I propose we make available our core product, Relativity, as a resource to obtain justice, not only to those who can afford our software, but to those who will never afford it.

Before we look at my proposal, let's spend a couple minutes reviewing current pro bono work and its relation to electronic discovery so we can grasp the weight of this opportunity.

Law firms have a long tradition of pro bono work. Many firms require new associates to take a set number of pro bono hours. Besides tradition, pro bono work is attractive to lawyers because it offers a chance to learn new aspects and fields of law they wouldn't risk on a paid contract. Pro bono work commonly addresses areas like:

- Children's rights
- Civil Rights
- Human trafficking
- Immigration
- Veterans benefits
- Wrongful convictions

In 2014, Kirkland & Ellis supplied an average 82 pro bono hours per attorney, McDermott Will and Emory 70, and Sidley Austin 63. What makes these firms interesting is that 1) They are Chicago-based, 2) They already use Relativity.

Since the first electronic discovery ammendment in 2006, e-discovery has become an ubiquitous part of litigation.  Yet pro bono work does not take advantage of e-discovery software AT ALL. Two reasons likely exist for this: 1) pro bono matters are too small or have little electronic data to warrant the use of fully featured e-discovery software, and 2) the cost of e-discovery software discourages law firms from using it for pro bono work.

Why do law firms restrict pro bono work to small matters? Is it that law firms want to keep their attorneys out of lengthy pro bono assignments? Or is it the nature of pro bono matters to be small and devoid of electronic data?

Even if we do determine historical precedent, times are changing. The Clinton email scandal is one of a new class of litigation where a single person's records may include over 30,000 electronic documents to review, redact, and distribute. Civil rights for the disadvantaged will increasingly hinge upon the review of electronic records to find and execute justice.

So, what if law firms didn't limit their pro bono work to small matters? What if law firms had an affordable way to manage a larger case with fewer staff? Would they take on more class action suits, as kCura lawyer Stan Pierson suggests?

There's an opportunity here that kCura is poised to capture, and for the sake of our social impact, the integrity of our business, and the promotion of our best technology I say we go for it.

First, we have an opportunity to make an incredible social impact. With growing volumes of data, only those who can afford the best tools get justice.  The rich settle matters based on the truth while the poor remain mired under loads of impenetrable data. Though the rich deserve justice as much as the poor, we have an opportunity to level the playing field and to model a socially responsible e-discovery software company. Because Relativity's cloud offering dramatically reduces the barrier to entry by shifting service costs to kCura, for the first time we have a direct way to transform how pro bono litigation conducts
e-discovery.

Again, we have an opportunity to wield our best work for good. We already help students learn by supplying vital technology needs in Chicago Public Schools. We also give funds to worthy causes through the kCura Gives program. But our core product, what we're most proud of and work hardest to make great, remains largely excluded from our generosity. This is a chance to direct the best of our product to serve the widest community yet.

Finally, We have an opportunity to promote our best technology. Law firms are not utilizing Relativity Analytics to its full potential; in some cases not at all. When the next generation Analytics is released, kCura will have to advocate for its usage all over again.  Lawyers who would never risk technology they don't understand on a paid matter may not have the same hesitation when conducting a pro bono matter. These same lawyers will become advocates for the value they've gained from new technology.  What if the next class action suit was successful because of Relativity Analytics?

We've looked at pro bono work and e-discovery, the changes that are taking place and the opportunities kCura is in a position to capture. So, where do we begin?

I propose we reimburse law firms for their pro bono Relativity usage. Each lawyer will be reimbursed up to 50 pro bono hours per year according to the NALP national average. This will encourage law firms to continue the practice of pro bono cases in the era of electronic discovery and equip over-worked pro bono lawyers with software that could literally change their lives and the lives of those they serve.

Our company will help sustain the efficacy of pro bono work into the electronic age by keeping services truly pro bono; from the lawyer's hours to the software they use to discover the truth. Will you take the leap?
