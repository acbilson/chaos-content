Sometimes I need web-available scratch paper. Until I have a better idea, this is it.

## 2023 Emphases

My goals broadly fall into three categories.

### Health

Health has been on the goal list for multiple years. It's certainly one of the least successful projects of the year. But the obstacles have been excessive, so let's try again this year. Broadly, there is bodily health, mental health, and spiritual health.

### Relationships

Besides the simple need for friends in a new town, relationships are a huge source of meaning and purpose. This has become more clear to me as I've aged and is likely to make the top for years to come. It's a broad encompassing my relationship with Amie, Graham and Royal, a wider range of family members, neighbors, local friends, and national/international friends.

### Joy

We're in Rapid City for respite and, while improved health and relationships do help with recovery, sometimes we just need to do things because they bring us joy.

Having just a small set of emphases may help keep my focus when new opportunities arise in the new year. We've typically had a larger swath of categories which, while they help us set goals in every area important to us, doesn't help with new priorities. We have had themes though, and they've had a similar effect as emphases.

## 2023 Goals

These are the full (unfiltered) list of goals. Many, but not all, will make the final list.

### Health

- Transition half our meals to a semi-diabetic diet
- Pursue regular weekly aerobic or anaerobic exercise
- Bicycle rides with the boys
- Swim lessons with the boys

### Centennial Trail

This goal is half exercise and respite and half community. My next steps are:

2. email an invite signup sheet
