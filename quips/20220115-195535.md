A few thoughts worth developing further.

1. The effect outsourcing apostolic gifting to parachurch orgs has on the local body. Loses partnership outside the building. Loses voice from the fringes. Loses the capacity to find, assess and disciple more apostles.

2. Clarify Kingdom Manifesto as the bleeding edge of the Body. Its not needed for the core to match (though it may benefit), but it is a coherent vision for the edges.

3. Think more about Internet-supported distance discipleship. After all these years, the people most on my heart are still those who I've sent/left. Maybe I'm not required to make a lot of friends in my local church to belong.

4. Note that Paul never sent a recorded epistle to Antioch. His heart was where he'd been invested, not his local church community.
