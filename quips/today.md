I've been briefly sidetracked by an exploration of NeoVim. This happens every couple years as I ponder whether it's time to switch from Vim to NeoVim. While I do like Conqueror of Completion (CoC), it would take some further education before I felt comfortable operating background processes myself (though :checkhealth helps a _ton_)
