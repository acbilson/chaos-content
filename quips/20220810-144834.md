## Politics

I'd like to do some more research on the factual claims Charlie O'Donnell makes, but [this](https://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2022/6/27/the-philosophy-that-underpins-the-right-its-not-what-you-think) is a compelling explanation for the confusing decisions of the Republican Party in the past few years.

Also in the political vein, [this](https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/03/08/they-are-preparing-war-an-expert-civil-wars-discusses-where-political-extremists-are-taking-this-country/) article by KK Ottesen is a compelling argument for the rise of an American insurgency. Also read Barbara Walter's [Is the US heading towards a civil war?](https://politicalviolenceataglance.org/2022/01/06/is-the-us-headed-toward-civil-war/)

One more. What is this book, [The Turner Diaries](https://www.npr.org/2019/04/02/708999681/turner-diaries-influence-on-white-nationalists-continues-to-grow)?

## Books

A book recommendation from Douglas, [Why Not Women?](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/why-not-women--a-biblical-study-of-women-in-missions-ministry-and-leadership_loren-cunningham_david-joel-hamilton/251893/item/3864173/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5urZ4KvR-AIViSZMCh2GBg72EAQYASABEgKwnvD_BwE#idiq=3864173&edition=2316645)
