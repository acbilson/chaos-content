Now that I've made a foray into web illustration, Maggie Appleton's list of [Illustration Books & Courses](https://maggieappleton.com/illustration-resources) is my new favorite resource! I may not ever achieve Maggie's expertise, but I'd like to draw simple illustrations and diagrams to explain concepts and to pretty up my garden.
