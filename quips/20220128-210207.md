A few more things worth their own exploration, or at least a place somewhere on my site...

## Parenting

In parenting, how do we handle rule differences? This is a challenge even between Amie and I, and then when you include other family members... Jeff Kaufman has an option in his article, [Grandpa Has Different Rules](https://www.jefftk.com/p/grandpa-has-different-rules).

## Business

A short business insight related to customer service from this quote:

{{< notice type=quote name="Jason Fried" src="https://world.hey.com/jason/no-big-deal-or-the-end-of-the-world-0b0d8619" >}}
Jean-Louis Gassée, who used to run Apple France, describes this situation as the choice of the two tokens. When you deal with people who have trouble, you can either choose to taken the token that says “it’s no big deal” or the token that says “it’s the end of the world”. Whichever token you pick, they’ll take the other.
