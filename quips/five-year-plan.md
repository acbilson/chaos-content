## 2022 Goals/Tasks

- distribute board member workload to ease board work
- search for replacement building maintenance source
- list potential disciples and pursue their friendship
- sketch a consulting roadmap with a security focus (or find one)

## Condo Board

After Amie's excellent idea, I've begun a roles and responsibilities document for the condo board. These roles can be offered to condo owners, which will distribute the effort to maintain the condo dramatically.

Tom's struggle to work with others is hurting his efforts to complete work in the building. He's also suffering more health issues as he ages and must share some of his responsibilities, which are numerous, with a maintenance partner that the board could work with in Tom's absence. He's been given several months to raise up an apprentice, and now it's time for the board to identify their own person or service.

## Disciple-making

What's daily obvious is that, whatever other hopes we have for our future, none of it happens outside of a team. We need a team.

It's clear that we'll have to become the team together. There's not a set of people ready-to-go who can simply be plugged in and we're off. Since [teams form through sustained relationship], we probably wouldn't want that anyways. This team forms through discipleship. It mustn't be formal, but it must be intentional. We have limited resources, so the number of direct disciples is probably 1-3. More than one is ideal, but we can't be too picky at this stage. Jesus didn't closely disciple more than three anyways. Ideas to engage our neighborhood swirl in my head, but without a team, it's all on me to figure out, organize, and execute. Not gonna happen. Even Paul went with Barnabas and John Mark on his first journey. [Paul didn't go alone]. Maybe he'd learned that much from Jesus' ministry?

## Career

With Amie's help I've narrowed down the career direction I'll share with Mike Hartmann tomorrow. The term 'consulting' sums up my answer.

While work is important to me, not only as a paycheck but also as a contribution and a source of enjoyment, it is subservient to my passion to make disciples. Therefore, while management is an area in which I might excel, the extra responsibility and time investment eats too much away from disciple-making. The same applies to my thoughts about SRE (Site Reliability Engineering), although the right position might work out. I could happily work at Performance Trust for the next decade if I was expanding my consulting skills along the way. Those skills are not limited to interesting coding projects, though they're welcome, but also chances to serve our customers in other entrepreneurial ways. I want to become a well-rounded consultant, not a specialist in one area but a capable partner in many. I may need to learn better how to sell myself, to craft business plans, build Blazor apps, etc.

If I must select an emphasis I'd like to develop in the next year, I'd say security. Just today Amie and I discovered that our doctor's office had been scammed. I want to develop more authority in the security front so that I can consult with others to help them improve their security practices. Software security is important and fun to me, definitely, but also the human element where almost all the damage happens.
