This year I'm hoping ðŸ¤ž to complete my Certified Master Ethical Hacker credential. Paying the fee to take the exam without an intensive prep time seems unwise, so I'm looking at the [MasterClass intensive program](https://iclass.eccouncil.org/masterclass-certified-ethical-hacker-program/?state=CEH%20Live%20In%20%E2%80%93%20April%2011-15,%202022#1578498062534-a27241ad-89e5).

Cybersecurity has fascinated me since my time in the U.S. Navy, and I'm excited to put an official label on my passion, and learn a ton!
