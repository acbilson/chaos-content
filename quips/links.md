While I haven't thoroughly read everything, I deeply appreciate [Talk Origins](http://www.talkorigins.org) FAQ page. It's refreshing to find an Internet source which promotes discussion of a heated topic, the origin of life. Most writing with a strong position is equally vitriolic towards its opposition, but this site doesn't fall into that trap (from what I've seen).

Linus Lee's article, [build tools around workflows](https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/) mirrors my own experience. I've kept notes in many software programs over the years, but there is always a point where I find my workflow has to conform to the program's design which causes cognitive friction. Eventually I stop using the tool. However, this hasn't happened ever since I've begun to run my own software suite. My software depends upon a bit more than Linus', but it's all open source so, unlike the sunsetting of private tools, I'll always have an original copy of the source.

I'm curious about the other workflows Linus mentions. I've sometimes wondered about keeping a people database to facilitate my memory. My Google contacts keeps names and contact info, but it's not useful to remember what we last spoke about or to note down a question I want to ask. A little thought about this reminds me that, the last time I considered mixing private and public access.

Also, gotta say, the [MS Surface Duo](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/configure/surface-duo/8p98gbqkdzl5/4tvl) looks pretty spectacular.

Also from Linus, his reasoning in [building Monocle](https://thesephist.com/posts/monocle/) gives me inspiration to continue building my own chaos suite, and particularly building infrastructure building blocks.

I wonder what I might learn from Linus' [thinking about communities](https://thesephist.com/posts/community-possibility/)? Much of what he explores fits with my present quandry in finding a place, not only to write, but also to engage others. It's not that I want to build a community per se, but I _do_ want to interact with others via some means other than Twitter and Facebook. How?
