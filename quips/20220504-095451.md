My programming language comprehension has drifted and it's made language selection more complicated. I might choose to write a program in C#, JavaScript, Go, Rust, or Python (not to mention HTML/SCSS and T-SQL). Most enterprise software I've built is in C# and Typescript, with some SQL. My own services run either Python or Go.

The ambiguity regularly makes we long for standardization. I spent a little while last year attempting to build C# podman images but found the build resources were too high and the image size was bloated. So I decided against C# standardization.

I'm not sure about using Go as a standard. It's similar enough to C# that I'm not sure it's worth the effort, plus I've been swayed by Rust developers that Go may not be an optimal low-level language.

It's becoming obvious that I won't be able to land on a single language, but a pair might do. Rust/Python seem like a good match. Rust is exceptional for low-level programs like CLIs, parsers, etc. Python, on the other hand, is an invaluable high-level language for scripting and web services. Rust could operate as it's own web service, so it's not crucial to use both in the same container, but the option is there. I wonder though if there needs to be a third language?
