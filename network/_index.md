I'm trying something new with the network. Instead of a d3.js rendered diagram (which wasn't very useful, even if it does look really cool), I'm going to list a single-level backlink reference. In future I might convert this into a diagram form, but for now a list will render more easily.

The purpose of this change is to make the network page a little more useful. Particularly, this can be my one-stop-shop to see how much of my site has been interlinked via backrefs. Eventually I'd like to improve the tree navigation through backrefs, and this is the first attempt.

To the left of the arrow is a post. It could be anything that has at least one reference from another post. On the right of the arrow are all the posts that reference that post.
