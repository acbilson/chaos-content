In The Different Kinds of Notes, Baldur concludes that there are essentially two organizational strategies, [Boxes and Maps](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2022/the-different-kinds-of-notes/#boxes-and-maps). Baldur deduces the two strategies differ only in what must be internalized.

## Boxes

A box is a context-external organizational unit. A cardboard box, a digital folder, a binder and a desk drawer might all qualify. Anything which matches the context label of the box can be found inside.

Boxes relieve the mind from sorting items by context, freeing it to visualize relationships.

## Maps

A map is a relation-external organizational unit. A mind map, a table of contents, etc.

Maps relieve the mind from relating items...

TODO: Turns out this is fairly difficult to internalize. Gonna have to sit with it a bit and see if I can make sense of Baldur's work.
