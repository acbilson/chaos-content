Baldur sees note-taking as answering one of [three questions](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2022/the-different-kinds-of-notes/#the-different-kinds-of-notes):

{{< raw >}}
<ol>
   <li>How do I manage my creativity?
      <ul>
         <li>Generate ideas in a structured way through research and sketching.</li>
         <li>Preserve those ideas.</li>
         <li>Explore the ideas until they have gelled into a cohesive plan or solved a problem.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>How do I manage my knowledge?
      <ul>
         <li>Extend your memory to help you keep track of useful information (client data, meeting notes, references).</li>
         <li>Connect that information to your current tasks or projects so that you can find it when you need it.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>How do I manage my understanding?
      <ul>
         <li>Break apart, reframe, and contextualise information and ideas so that they become a part of your own thought process.</li>
         <li>Turn learning into something you can outline in your own words.</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ol>

The note-taking tools one might build are formed by the priorities of each question.

A creative-first note-taking tool favors flexible expression over organization or recall. A blank canvas.

A knowledge-first note-taking tool favors structured recall over flexibility. A database.

An understanding-first note-taking tool favors atomicity and relationship over recall or flexibility. A mind map.
