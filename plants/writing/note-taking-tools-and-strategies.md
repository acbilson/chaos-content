A broad review of note-taking strategies for long-form writing was conducted by Baldur Bjarnason in a three-part series as part of his [Colophon Cards](https://www.colophon.cards) project.

Before reading Baldur's excellent research, you should know that {{< backref src="/plants/writing/notes-are-a-means-to-an-end" >}}. Much of note-taking is a form of idea-hoarding, but Baldur's research is sourced from writers who use note-taking **for** something, whether a thesis, a book, or some other project.

In a survey, Baldur synthesized the various ways people use note-taking into the management of either {{< backref src="/plants/writing/note-taking-answers-three-questions" name="Creativity, Knowledge, or Understanding" >}}. These categories broadly divide the note-taking tool market and the ends that people seek when using a new tool.

Baldur deduces that there are two organizational strategies to note-taking, {{< backref src="/plants/writing/notes-as-maps-or-boxes" >}}.

{{< backref src="/plants/writing/note-taking-answers-three-questions" name="Purpose" >}} is one perspective you might take when researching note-taking and the tools at your disposal. Another is process. Baldur reduces the note-taking into three steps: [Collect, Contextualize, and Map](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2022/the-different-kinds-of-notes/#collect). In his formulation, {{< backref src="/plants/writing/note-taking-process-towards-an-end" name="Note-taking Moves Towards An End Via a Process" >}}.

## Reflection

I have no writing projects to complete. But I do have ways of being to be formed into. This may be a note-taking category that's not covered by Baldur's research, but I think note-taking can have an effect on the formation of:

- a wise and gracious father and husband
- a trusting and faithful disciple of Jesus
- an organized and proficient software engineer

Habits tend to be helped by journal-like entries and reflection. There’s not much need for a digital garden, but a log is useful.

Aspects of formation can be relevant to a writing project. Deciding a parenting strategy for conflict resolution is greatly helped by writing a guide.

A project thesis or a state of being promotes social interaction. I might share a bare article and ask for feedback, but it’s better to have an underlying thesis to discuss or characteristic to grow. For example, “how have you become more patient?” is a fruitful dialog - “what do you think of my post about types of patience” is not (though it may be written in pursuit of the thesis).

TODO: add reflection about the use of note-taking for formation.
