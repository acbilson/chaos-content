I'd really like to write responses to the most interesting articles that I read. Maybe in agreement, maybe in dissent. Until that project takes off, here's a list I'll build.

[Grandpa Has Different Rules](https://www.jefftk.com/p/grandpa-has-different-rules).

A short business insight related to customer service from this quote:

{{< notice type=quote name="Jason Fried" src="https://world.hey.com/jason/no-big-deal-or-the-end-of-the-world-0b0d8619" >}}
Jean-Louis Gassée, who used to run Apple France, describes this situation as the choice of the two tokens. When you deal with people who have trouble, you can either choose to taken the token that says “it’s no big deal” or the token that says “it’s the end of the world”. Whichever token you pick, they’ll take the other.

Linus Lee's article, [build tools around workflows](https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/) mirrors my own experience. I've kept notes in many software programs over the years, but there is always a point where I find my workflow has to conform to the program's design which causes cognitive friction. Eventually I stop using the tool. However, this hasn't happened ever since I've begun to run my own software suite. My software depends upon a bit more than Linus', but it's all open source so, unlike the sunsetting of private tools, I'll always have an original copy of the source.
