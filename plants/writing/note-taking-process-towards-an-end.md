{{< backref src="/plants/writing/note-taking-answers-three-questions" name="Purpose" >}} is one perspective you might take when researching note-taking and the tools at your disposal. Another is process.

Baldur reduces all note-taking into three steps: [Collect, Contextualize, and Map](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2022/the-different-kinds-of-notes/#collect).

## Collect

The first step is simply to get the note into your repository. Whether it's a cardboard box or a digital Kanban board, the priority is speed and reference.

## Contextualize

This step will have different needs depending on the writer's purpose. Creativity, strewn with sketches, colors and objects, needs a tactile way to shuffle items into piles/buckets. Knowledge, with its data-driven records, favors automation and hard links between distinct objects. Understanding, with its networks and interrelationships, lands somewhere between the two, with both tactile and hard links serving to build a structure of interrelated ideas.

If you donâ€™t integrate what you collect, are just building an ever more intimidating database of opaque words and alien ideas.

## Map

Most note-taking I've seen stops at conceptualize. The concept of a Map of Content is the closest correlary, where notes within a context may grow into a directory which could be developed as a paper or blog post. Baldur describes the map as a distinct step towards an end product, not an aggregated conceptualization.
