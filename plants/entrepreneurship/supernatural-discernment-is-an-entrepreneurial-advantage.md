**Entrepreneurs accurately discern actions and events because of Jesus' enlightenment.**

Jesus said to his disciples, "I am the light of the world, whoever follows me will not walk in darkness but will have the light of life (_ESV_, John 8:12)." Because he follows his Father, he knows where he has come from and where he is going. He has come from the Father and he is returning to the Father (John 13:3). He does not judge, but when Jesus does it will be true judgment because he doesn't judge by himself but the Father judges with him (John 8:14-16).

As Jesus knows where he is from because he walks in the light of the Father, so we know where we have come from. Jesus sent us; we are from him. He knows where he is going, and so do we. We are going to be received by Jesus into the fullness of his kingdom.  And as Jesus judges the hearts of men because the Father also judges, so we are able to discern (judge) the full nature of men's actions and the events we encounter because of Jesus' influence.

## Importance

In business, as in life, things aren't always as they seem. Key information is hidden that could dramatically change an entrepreneur's decisions. One employee wants to spite his manager, another is afraid of the consequences if he mentions a defect. A business deal depends on one party's ignorance of the quality of their merchandise. A financial document is faked to deceive the public.

An entrepreneur who judges by the flesh only sees what's before them. They cannot grasp the impact of spiritual matters on their decisions, and they have no assistance from the Spirit in their discernment. They walk in darkness. Those who follow the light of the world, however, do have spiritual discernment. They rely upon the Father's judgment when making decisions, and they see the spiritual effects both of their own and other's actions. They walk in the light, and they know both where they've come from and where they're going.

## Application

Decisions are often made with incomplete information. How much more an entrepreneur. He must often make decisions based on the feedback of his customers and the perspective he's gained on the market. He's never 100% sure that he's on the right track, and often has to take chances to discover what the truth is.

When I see Jesus' confidence in the truth he knows and his offer to enlighten us in our path after him, I have courage to take risks. I know that Jesus has sent me, that I will be received again by him, and that he will judge and tell me of his judgment in murky situations. He knows the hearts of men, and with his help I too will escape the snares laid for me by my enemies.
