## Business Description

A business book written by budding entrepreneurs with insight into the integration of open Christian faith and daily business.  Published for Kindle first and, if the buyers back it up, printed in bulk.

### Step 1: Determine Your Target Customer

A young (20-40's) entrepreneur or business leader with a spiritual desire to effect lasting and sustainable change among their peers and in their community through a holistic spiritual lifestyle.  He's read a number of business and leadership books already but hasn't found a book which deals honestly in the area he considers most important - spiritual openness.  Most of all, he hasn't found a book that advocates spiritually open business from the opening day that addresses his fears and satisfies his questions.  He's turned off by the number of books which claim God's will blessing if he puts their principles into practice.  He's disappointed by the authors who have an understanding of the Bible but cannot translate it into a business.  He's ready for a new voice.

### Step 2: Identify Underserved Customer Needs

Many Christians I have spoken to have lost hope that their spiritual lives could ever integrate into their daily work.  The purpose of their work is often limited to bread-winning and neither their pastor nor their community communicates any alternative.  The stubborn few become abrasive to their co-workers as they force Christian teaching into their work lives while the silent majority watches in pain and vows never to humiliate themselves in the same way.  The general consensus echoes what is said of teachers, "Those who can, minister.  The rest join the workforce."

### Step 3: Define Your Value Proposition

The book's value lies in each author's experience in the business world and the practical and worldview-challenging nature of its content.  If the book helps any reader, fantastic, but its value will be measured first by the impact it has on the community.  If it challenges authors to address this silent topic, even if only to disagree, it will generate discussion and draw out the full measure of dissatisfaction American Christians experience regarding this subject.  In order to do this, it needs to be true to the cultural landscape and the content of the Bible.

### Step 4: Specify Your MVP Feature Set

- Stirring blog posts on the topic of spiritual integration
- Advocacy from at least two spiritual and/or business leaders

### Step 5: Create Your MVP Prototype

The prototype has been written already by the four of us students.  With a little editing, our clearest and strongest writing on spiritual integration could be presented as a blog.  There's enough content for a couple months at one post per week, and our readers are simple to find and contact as many of them are already in our circle of influence.  Before the content ran out we'd have what we need to know to pivot or to persevere to a fully published work.  Before the blog was published, an advocate or two in our local community could dramatically improve the success of the enterprise by legitimizing the content.
