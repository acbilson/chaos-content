**Love protects from a host of employment law violations.**

One of the fastest routes to a headache is to read the reams of employment laws. Discrimination based on gender? Check. Age? Check. Race, religion, disability? Triple-check. Even genetic information such as an employee's mother's heart condition could be grounds for a discrimination suit. Mazin, Rebecca, and Smith explain that "one of the most challenging tasks you will face in human resources management is complying with employment-related laws ({smith-hr}, pg. 153)." Is the only option to take some Aspirin and buy a book on labor laws? As Paul states, "I will show you a still more excellent way (_ESV_, 1Cor 12:31b)." Love.

"Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins (_ESV_, 1Pe 4:8)." Love covers a multitude of employment laws too. An employer who cares for the employee who just discovered their father has terminal cancer will never face accusations of a breach in FMLA because they will bless their employee to take extended leave to care for their father and will hold a place for their return. No discrimination suits will stick when the employer values people of every culture, race or gender equally and demonstrates this with equal pay and opportunity. A loving employer sees his over forty employees is an asset to the company and values their contribution above the potential for increased medical costs.

Any company pushing fifty employees or more faces the challenge of educating their growing management base to the vast U.S. discrimination legislation. The options available often fall to the fallacy of bifurcation - that only two options exist. Either an employer pays for regular discrimination training and keeps a lawyer or two on reserve, or they pay for the inevitable discrimination suit. But the wise employer discovers a third option, the pathway of love.

Love is rarely cost-free, so this direction will never sell to an employer who wants only to cut costs. Let that employer build their protective hedges with trainings and paperwork. The employer who genuinely desires the best for his employees will find that his efforts are rewarded by a company culture that's resistant to discrimination on any basis and compliant with nearly every employment law in existence. This protection is international, for a loving company is more likely to comply to the minimum requirements of any nation on earth.
