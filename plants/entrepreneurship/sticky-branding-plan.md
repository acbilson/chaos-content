##Principle 1: Simple Clarity

The Construction Site makes technical business interactions between U.S. and Omani companies successful by framing the traveler's visit with culturally sound supports.  Cultural roadblocks are identified and detoured with short and powerful consultations from local business people.  Readable signs guide on-site negotiators from their introduction to the parting handshake.  Bridges are built across the table, the ocean, and the world.

##Principle 2: Tilt The Odds

The Construction Site offers a custom-built experience for U.S.-based technology companies who know partnership with Omani companies is a lucrative opportunity and want their on-site interactions to stay between the lines and avoid potholes.  Unlike other cultural coaches, our team is made up of local business people who understand the dynamics of business in Oman because they live it day in, day out.  We are shoulder-to-shoulder with business associates instead of teachers of two-day culture seminars.  When communication breaks down, we are right next door.
Technology companies have a language all their own, and our company is fluent.  From the American owners to the Omani coaches, we have years of experience in the technology field and the disciplines of software management.

##Principle 3: Function That Resonates

Your SaaS business is ready to expand.  You know that, in order to deliver 24-7 support for global users you'll need another operation overseas.  India is too risky, and England too expensive.  That's when you discover the hidden resources of Oman, but you question whether you can navigate a Middle Eastern culture.  You don't want to start from scratch; you need a frame for the partnership you want to build, with clear signs to show where the concrete is poured and when you'll need a hard hat.  You need The Construction Site team.

##Principle 4: Engage The Eye

The Construction Site has a ubiquitous number of images it can use to be readily identified.  The logo is the frame of a building, which conjures the idea of design and building something to last.  The website will have the images of a construction site; dusty navigation signs, yellow hard hats, and wrap-around safety glasses.  Marketing can use video of demolished structures to show the result of poor execution and can borrow from the stories of earthquake-safe skyscrapers to show the purpose of flexibility.  Visual material isn't likely to be a problem, and can be tailored to a number of age groups and national backgrounds.

##Principle 5: Total Customer Experience

Although our target is U.S. based technology companies, our customers will be the people sent to Oman on business trips.  Instead of office training before they go, a brief brocure will be emailed to the business associated by one of our representatives before they board the plane with practical information about the flight and landing at Muscat International Airport.  The same representative will pick them up from the airport (or the hotel if they've slept first) and offer to take them to an authentic Omani breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  Interwoven will be practical tips about cultural cues in Oman, but it will also be a warm and person-centered way of welcoming them to a foreign context.  We will only work with companies who invest at least a week for partnership with Oman and will schedule follow-ups that connect the associate with an Omani business person who can answer questions regarding their experience and offer advice for future negotiations.  These will be brief, no more than an hour, and welcoming.  When the associate departs we will debrief with them about their experience and send them back with an Omani souvenir.

##Principle 6: Brand Storyline

Our story will center on the positive experiences of our customers by telling the experience of people who land in Oman without cultural assistance and end up unable to build lasting partnership, and those whose business has grown because of their Omani partnerships.
