**Follow industry and business model methods for financial accounting, but with care.**

Few businesses have revolutionary models. Most are a slight variation on an existing model, or even an exact replica for a different market. Business models develop useful ways to approach accounting that are unique to their type. A manufacturing business need not think deeply about how it will record materials costs because it's already standard practice to record these under COGS (cost of goods sold). It would not make sense for a manufacturing company to borrow a software company's financial reports as a template - this would deflate the manufacturing company's gross profit in unhelpful ways. To avoid confusion and the monumental task of inventing one's own accounting determinations, it behooves most companies to form their financial statements in the same was others do in their industry and using their business model.

Unscrupulous accounting practices may arise from wicked motives, but for the most part business owners recognize that accurate, well-matched financial statements equip them to run a profitable business. The value of an accounting style may be proven by a company only after several months of reports are absorbed and acted on by its managers. Likewise, a poorly-matched accounting style may cause confusion and detract from wise financial decisions but not be identified as a suspect until months of usage. A wise business owner won't waste time with other people's mistakes, but will adopt the standards of others in her industry of a similar size and business model.

A note of warning about adopting other's financial standards; it's only as good as theirs is. The software platform industry has set a high value on two intangible assets: data and network effect. Many Silicon Valley startups have been purchased for tens of millions of dollars simply to acquire the data and network that business has accumulated. While the market valuation of data stays high, adopting the software industry's approach to data valuation will give your financial statements a great boost and make your company appear much more profitable. If data privacy standards like GDPR were to be implemented in the U.S.; however, this would cause data to became a legal liability. Your business would be foolhardy to continue to value your data as highly.

The company I work for claims that the financial information they supply employees is above average for our industry, and I believe them. Knowing how poorly the software industry has accounted for its value; however, makes me question the wisdom of a practice where most companies do not give even cursory financial information to their employees. Our accounting practices are likely to be similar to other software companies, which means that if I were to understand a publicly traded software company's accounting style I could understand the few numbers we're given even better. One aspect that concerns me is that as an employee I'm given information about our business revenue, but no information about expenses or liabilities. Revenue continues to go up, and all employees are glad and think we're doing well, but the missing factors could paint a much different story. I'm not convinced that they would given other factors at play, but it does concern me that this is considered above average financial transparency.
