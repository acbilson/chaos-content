**Deliver post-MBA graduates consulting experience in their dream field.**

**Business Description:** MBA graduates who desire to integrate their studies with the daily practice of a startup find it a challenge to connect with entrepreneurs who will pay for their consulting services. These graduates may face 'imposter syndrome' - the sense their education belies their ability - and desire a testing ground for the concepts they have learned. A consultant who acts as a middleman between the fresh MBA student and a selection of businesses, who will connect the student with a personalized business tailored to their MBA experience and will benefit the business by identifying talented managers, partners, and consultants available for hire.

**Proposed Country & City:** Chicago as the hub, with connections to universities with graduate-level business programs across the United States.

**Multicultural Dimensions:** The customers of this business will comprise the full range of cultures MBA students from universities such as GLU, Booth, and Keller represent. To cater to a diverse crowd, the consulting opportunities must reflect diverse values. There must be startups and established businesses, local businesses and multi-nationals as consulting partners.

**Proposed Customers:** The primary customer segment will be fresh MBA graduates (under six months after their graduation), with an interest in a field of work they have less than a year's prior experience in. They have a sense of the style of the company they would like to work in, or the startup they'd like to help launch, but lack the experience to connect their MBA studies with the practice of business. It's likely they will be under thirty years old, and may have entered their MBA program shortly after their Bachelor's degree was completed. It is possible older MBA graduates may be interested if they intend to transition to a new field of which they have little experience.
