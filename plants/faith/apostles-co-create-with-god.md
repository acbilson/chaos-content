When I ponder the spiritual gifts listed in Ephesians, {{< acronym APEST "Apostles Prophets Evangelists Shepherds & Teachers" >}}, I think about function. What does an apostle _do_? How is it different/similar to the evangelist's gift? Rarely do I consider the experience of using the gift with God.

Jessie Cruickshank offers a [beautiful homily](https://yourbrainbyjess.com/apostolic-birthing/) on the parental feeling inherent in giving birth to God's kingdom in the world. She {{< backref name="meditates on Mary's experience as the God-bearer" src="/stones/jessie-cruickshank/it-is-a-deeply-intimate-way-of-knowing-god-to-co-create" >}}, the prophets of the LORD, and the artisans of the Tabernacle. Using language familiar to the apostle Paul, she describes the joyful burden, the happy sacrifice of giving birth to a new community. Likening the experience to birthing and raising a child, she magnifies the relationship of the creator to their work and confronts the false distance that some serial creators keep from their creations to avoid pain.
