Sometimes it's thought that the Hebrew Bible is more judgment-focused while the Greek Bible is grace-focused, but it just takes more pondering to see it in the first 3/4 of the Bible. For example, in the Noah story, the LORD reflects on the human condition and determines that humans from Noah's generation will be no better than those wiped out in the flood for filling the earth with violence. Nevertheless, He promises to never again destroy all living things with a deluge. But even though He knows that Noah's descendants will be wicked, He still commands Noah to be fruitful and multiply, just like he said to Adam. He wants more, many more, of us!

This flies against modern thought. Whether it's because we feel that introducing more humans into this chaos isn't fair to them or because humans resemble a plague on the earth, the birth rate in America and many other countries demonstrates our values; it'd be better to have fewer of us around.
