**To be just is to act to supply those in need without partiality.**

> "For the LORD your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe. He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing (_ESV_, Deuteronomy 10:17-18)."

As I reviewed the many passages about justice for the fatherless and the widow, so many refer to defense and the absence of oppression that it seems a righteous person is one who doesn't directly harm the poor. This autobiographical description of God closely ties justice with love, and both with the service of practical needs in the supply of food and clothing.

This command is uncomfortably foreign to me. Apart from the homeless I pass along my way to work, I have no interaction with the fatherless, the widow, or the sojourner. If I were to speak of my just behavior, all I would have is an absence of deliberate, direct harm to another. While many passages clear my conscience by speaking of active oppression towards the vulnerable, this holds me captive to a higher standard. I'm not certain how to apply this faithfully in my present circumstances without making deliberate changes, and that's likely to be the same way for a business I would start. To be like God; however, means a more deliberate approach than doing no harm; it means doing good to those in need.
