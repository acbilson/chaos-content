Merton speaks of a true self that only God knows, a self formed by the person and God in union together. Other selves are false, masks we wear that can’t be real for God does not recognize them.

We fear God’s presence because, as a consuming fire, he burns up false selves and leaves only what’s true. We don’t know who will be left when He’s through, and the loss of the identities we cling to feels like death.
