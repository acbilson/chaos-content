It's common American practice to reduce complex concepts into byte-sized marketing messages. Many Christians think of a verse or two written by Paul when they hear the word "gospel." A few hear gospel hallelujahs. Even fewer think of the first four books in the New Testament.

The word "gospel" translates the Greek word εὐαγγελίου. Transliterate the Greek and you get the English word "evangel"; the root of "evangelist" and "evangelism". Literally the word translates "good news."

Mark believed his writings were the gospel. He begins his narrative with this line:

> The beginning of the good news [εὐαγγελίου] of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. (_ESV_, Mark 1:1)

He expands his gospel definition to the Prophets in the next sentence:

> As it is written in Isaiah the prophet (_ESV_, Mark 1:2)

One's definition of the gospel is fundamental to their content and approach to evangelism. If your definition is summed up in Paul's letter to the Corinthians,

> For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures (_ESV_, 1 Corinthians 15:3-4)

then your message centers on synopses of the final moments in the Gospel narratives and your approach is to ensure that hearers receive your bullet-point narrative. For whatever reason, this definition seems more prevalent among conservative Evangelical circles.

# The Gospel as Story

## Practices To Try

- Share a story about Jesus. Memorize it so it becomes part of you, not to deliver it verbatim. In fact, feel free to put the story in your own words. Then share the story in casual conversation with someone and see what happens. You might say something like, "That reminds me about this one time..." If you're nervous, you can ask first, "May I share a story about Jesus with you? I think you'd enjoy it."

- Share a story about encountering Jesus.
