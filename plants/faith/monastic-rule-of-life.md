The Order of the Common Life has four rhythms and twelve commitments that comprise their [Rule of Life](https://www.orderofthecommonlife.org/rule).

> I still have my reservations. Yes, I think these are good things, but I'm not sure that this expression of spiritual disciplines is right for me. It feels like something could be missing, and a few of these are values that I'm not likely to follow through with, like _lectio divina_ or shared work. This sucks that one must pay to get help in one's spiritual life.

# Rhythms

## Bodily Labor

I affirm that humans are embodied beings and that our bodies are good and equal to our minds and spirits. The use of our bodies in physical work builds strength and reveals our human limits.

## Prayer

Individually, every day we practice examen at midday and before bed. Prayer melded with scripture through practices such as the Daily Office or _lectio divina_ is also encouraged.

## Study

We grow in understanding of God and ourselves through weekly study related to the direction of the Spirit and our gifts.

## Rest

To embrace our limits and foster a lifestyle of trust, we seek to embed healthy rest, sufficient sleep, and weekly Sabbath into our routines.

# Commitments

## Silence, Solitude, and the Contemplative Life

Quiet within and without lets us perceive God's voice. Solitude weakens our attachments and gives space for the Spirit to reorder them. And this is all directed towards an awareness of God's voice and work in the world around us.

## Spiritual Direction

We are assisted in noticing God's voice and leading in our lives when we share our discoveries with a listening person.

## Spiritual Friendship

Intimate friendship with those who share common priorities and passions is crucial.

## Discernment Within Community

The Spirit is within each member of our community and we hear God's voice best when it's affirmed by the group.

## Simplicity

Clutter is antithetical to a listening life because it creates noise and stuff vies for attention.

## Consecration of Love in Celebacy and Marriage

## Hospitality

## Expression of Faults and Affirmations

## Formational Healing

## Shared Economy

## Shared Work

## Service to the Church
