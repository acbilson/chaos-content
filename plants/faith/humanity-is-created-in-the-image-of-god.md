{{< notice type=quote src="Genesis 1:27-28 (ESV)" >}}
So God created man in his own image,
in the image of God he created him;
male and female he created them.

And God blessed them. And God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth."
{{< /notice >}}

Humanity is created in God's image. Not male or female, but the whole batch together. It's not _technically_ wrong to say that you or I are individual images, but the Genesis conception is a community, rather than an individual, expression. This shouldn't surprise us greatly, since Yahweh himself is a community.

## Genesis And Darwin

There's plenty to reject in the scientific community, the evidence for an emerging creation is strong. One might ignore scientific evidence or explain away Genesis, but there's a better, if messier, wayâ€“Integration.

The fellows at Bio Logos have written an excellent summary of the trouble, [How could humans have evolved and still be in the Image of God?](https://biologos.org/common-questions/how-could-humans-have-evolved-and-still-be-in-the-image-of-god)

I haven't read everything, but I deeply appreciate [Talk Origins](http://www.talkorigins.org) FAQ page. It's refreshing to find an Internet source which promotes discussion of this heated topic, the origin of life. Most writing from a strong position is vitriolic towards its opposition, but this site doesn't fall into that trap (from what I've seen).
