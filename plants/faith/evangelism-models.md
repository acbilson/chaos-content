## Healing Prayer

Many people's first introduction to Jesus was news about the people who were healed by him. The leper who approaches Jesus saying that, if he is willing, Jesus can make him clean is a classic example (Mark 1:40-44).

When I see a person in distress because of an illness, I remember that Jesus heals and wonder if he might heal this person. But uncertainty usually takes hold of me. What should I say? What if nothing happens?

While it's not impossible to stroll up and ask if they'd like to be made well (John 5:6), I might find it helpful to share a short story of a time Jesus heals someone. This will help discern the state of the sick person and stir up their faith. Those who are sick sometimes wish to be left alone or have attempted everything, even prayer, and are not open to another attempt. Others long to be made well and would risk any humiliation.

## Shema/Salty Statements

If you jettison the mistaken notion that the good news Jesus and Paul preached was a canned statement, as useful as concise declarations can be (see {{< backref src="/plants/faith/what-is-the-gospel" >}}), and you can get on board with the idea that you're searching for disciples (see both {{< backref src="/plants/faith/find-the-peaceful-people" >}} and {{< backref src="/plants/faith/evangelism-is-making-disciples" >}}), then you might ask, how do you actually _find_ a possible disciple?

One of the best ways I know of is the Shema, or salty, statement. In essence, these are verbal hints that indicate your spiritual life and connection with Jesus.

Some say that it's good just to make sure folks know you're a spiritual person. I don't see anything wrong with that. However, my first inclination is to introduce them directly to Jesus in some form. Healing prayer does this via direct communication with Jesus via the Spirit; our statements should do something similar. This is why I prefer to use stories or parables as salty statements over "last week I went to church."

Stories about the Kingdom don't have to be verbatim from the Gospels (although that's a good place to start if you're nervous. A memorized story from the Gospels, told in your own words, is wonderful). Since {{< backref="/plants/writing/short-stories-are-modern-parables" >}}, any story with an ounce of Kingdom in it has power, whether it be a personal story, someone else's story, or something you make up like an actual parable.
