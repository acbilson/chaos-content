I want to more deeply investigate the gift and identity of the apostle. For examples I have Jesus, Paul, Peter, and others. But I don't know where to begin, so here's an outline:

- Apostles and Entrepreneurs (partially written)
- Apostles and Priorities
- Apostles and the other gifts (why no one is apostle-only, and what the other gifts mean for it)
