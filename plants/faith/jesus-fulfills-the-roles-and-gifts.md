I'm often struck by the upside-down way that Jesus represents the roles of prophet, priest and king and the gifts: apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd and teacher (APEST).

He is a king, but he does not use his authority to wage war upon Rome as the insurrectionists planned or as King David did against the surrounding nations. Instead He used the kingly authority to deliver and serve. He is a prophet, and... well, actually, His prophetic acts seem identical to the prophets of old. He is a priest, but He offers forgiveness to the paralized man inside a home instead of the temple cloister.

I want to spend more time considering how He fulfills APEST, and how his fulfillment of APEST also {{< backref name="fulfills the Imago Dei" src="all-biblical-roles-and-gifts-express-imago-dei" >}}. Here's a jumping-off point:

Along with all other varied dimensions of humanity, the fivefold APEST archetypes existing in fallen humanity are taken up into the very person of Christ and are thereby redeemed and reconfigured in and through his perfect life and his holy offering on the cross!

And to explore what each looks like in Jesus' ministry, it may help to explore {{< backref src="/plants/faith/what-is-the-five-fold-ministry" >}}.
