In what ways can an individual mobilize prayer among his friends and neighbors for their community?

One powerful means are visualizations. A simple map opens the mind to the shape of one's community and inspires creative ways to engage within the boundaries of a neighborhood. It can easily be shared and further layers can be added to track any number of topics you may be praying towards.

If you wonder how I created this map, here are the steps.<br /><br />

First, create an Excel/Numbers/CSV file and add two headers, family and address. In the first column, put the names of everyone you've met at that residence. In the second, the address (no commas). Export this to a CSV file.<br /><br />

Second, navigate to <a class="outref" href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/?hl=en">your Google maps</a> (you may have to log in). Create a new map, then select [Add layer] -> [Import] and select your CSV file.
