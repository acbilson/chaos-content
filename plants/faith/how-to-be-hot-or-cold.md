{{< notice type=quote short=true name="Revelation 3:15-17 (ESV)" >}}
â€˜I know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were either cold or hot! So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth.
{{< /notice >}}

This excerpt starts Jesus' rebuke of the Laodicieans. On its surface, it's a vivid rebuke of a church community that has lost its way. But what does this mean, "cold or hot"?

Maybe you've heard that "hot" is an exhortation to be "on fire" in your evangelism, prayer life, healing ministry, etc. By inference, "cold" would thus be completely dead to sharing about Jesus, praying, healing or any other Christian practice. In my experience, cold is usually skipped because, while the hot metaphor resonates with people, it's cold counterpart doesn't match our understanding of Jesus' character at all.

What if "hot" and "cold" were references to the notable water sources in the Laodicean region? Laodiciea was recognized for both mountain springs, ice-cold and refreshing, and also hot springs, warm and soothing. Their town also had tepid water so full of minerals that, if one were to drink it, it would cause them to vomit.

This image isn't of a disgusted God ready to vomit out a church of nominal Christians but an analogical appeal using the church's renouned springs to be a people who offer refreshment and healing to their neighbors.
