It's an uncomfortable, wonderful experience to read an author who views the world in stark contrast to my perspective. That's been my experience with _The Seven Storey Mountain_ by Thomas Merton.

There's much to discover in Merton's autobiography. I hadn't realized that Dante's _Inferno_, from which Merton took his book's title, doesn't end with the circles of hell, but with a climb up purgatory. I also learned the names of prayer times; for example, nighttime prayer is called Compline (pronounced complin). But the best was Merton's humble ability to communicate his thoughts and feelings as a young man when he wrote his book later in life.

How difficult it is to remember the emotions; the fears and the passions of my youth! Merton exhibits astonishing insight and humility by writing his early life with such genuine veracity that I could not distinguish whether he held a conviction as a writer or only at the age he was in the timeline. He never hedges his true beliefs at a young age, even if they were ludicrous or half-formed, nor does he apologize for them.

I had not realized the book was an autobiography when I purchased it. Nor that I would find his description of the daily office so compelling that I would begin to attempt a similar practice myself. It was the Holy Spirit who prompted me to read this book about fifteen years after it was recommended to me, and I am grateful for his timely direction. Definitively recommend.
