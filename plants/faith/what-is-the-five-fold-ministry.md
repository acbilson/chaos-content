The acronym {{< acronym APEST "Apostle Prophet Evangelist Shepherd & Teacher" >}} describes five spiritual gifts that {{< backref name="Christ embodied" src="/plants/faith/jesus-fulfills-the-roles-and-gifts" >}} and distributed to humanity. It's not the only list of spiritual gifts, but it's the one that seems most to describe the architecture of a church community, since these are given for the building up of the Church. But what are they exactly?

5Q Central describes the five gifts by the question, "What would this gift do with a bar of chocolate?"

{{< notice type=quote long=true name="5Q Central" src="https://5qcentral.com/when-the-hand/" >}}
<p><b>APOSTLE:</b> If an Apostle had an amazing piece of chocolate what would she do with it? Understanding the value of the chocolate she would immediately want to find a way to get that chocolate into the hands of every person in the United States in the fastest, most efficient and cost effective way possible. She would have vision, big pictures, and purpose in mind.</p>

<p><b>PROPHET:</b> The Prophet would see the chocolate and know that we have been given the role of stewardship. She would ask questions like, “What did God intend for the use of this chocolate and how do we maintain God’s purposes?” She would be attuned to the heart of God, but ALSO be aware of the Shalom of God’s people. She would be mindful that nobody had too much and none too little. She would be a deep listener to both God and people and only cry out after all the dots between God’s intention and the Shalom of the community had been identified (and too often abused).</p>

<p><b>EVANGELIST:</b> The Evangelist would take one taste of the amazing chocolate and then insist that everyone she knows would (not just should) TRY IT! No questions asked. She believes it! You should too! She infectiously communicates the power of chocolate and everyone should join along. It is hard to get her to entertain any thought beyond her own belief, because she is sure of what she has experienced! (We all know these people from food to phone preferences)!</p>

<p><b>SHEPHERD:</b> The Shepherd immediately would see the chocolate as a gift to the community.  It would be used as a way to communicate care and love to the community. It is a source of celebration and a source of comfort and even a source of reward after challenge.</p>

<p><b>TEACHER:</b> The Teacher would be concerned about the origins of the chocolate. They could give you the historical context for the discovery of chocolate, how its purpose have evolved over history, as well as possibly the chemical make up — the deconstruction and reconstruction of the perfect chocolate morsel would be their utmost concern. It must be rightfully thought out and historically and contextually accurate.</p>

## Gifts By Music (In Progress)

Another way to explore the gifts is to ask, "What does this _sound_ like?" Here are a few examples by song:

## Evangelist/Prophet - Keith Green

Prime example:

- Asleep in the Light (Evangelist/Prophet)

{{< poetry >}}
Do you see? Do you see?
All the people sinking down?
Don't you care? Don't you care?
Are you gonna let them drown?
How can you be so numb?
Not to care if they come
You close your eyes and pretend the job's done

Oh, bless me, Lord! Bless me, Lord!"
You know, it's all I ever hear
No one aches, no one hurts
No one even sheds one tear
But, He cries, He weeps, He bleeds
And He cares for your needs
And you just lay back and keep soaking it in

...

Come away, come away
Come away with Me, My love

## Prophet - Common Hymnal

- God Will Heal Our Wounds (Prophet)

{{< poetry >}}
If we stop loving on our own terms
God will heal our wounds, God will heal our wounds
