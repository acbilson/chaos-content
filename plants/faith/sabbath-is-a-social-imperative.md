{{< notice type=quote short=true name="Exodus 20:8-10 (ESV)" >}}
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates.
{{< /notice >}}

The Sabbath commandment in Exodus is corporate. The address expands from the hearer to all who relate to them, from their children to their employees, their guests and even their animals. Private rest does not fulfill the requirement if the rest of those around us is unmet. This is social rest, a rest for me and all who are with me.

The Sabbath commandment is directed to the powerful. To whom was the command addressed except the head of household, the heads of the family? For they are the only one here unlisted, and it is in their power to grant rest to others.
