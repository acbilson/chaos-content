**Money is a cruel master, but God is a life-giving master.**

"He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity. When goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes? Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep (_ESV_, Ecclesiastes 5:10-12)."

Jesus said that it was impossible to serve both God and money (Matthew 6:24). For those who choose money, they will find that it neither satisfies nor remains, nor brings good to the owner. Those who labor to amass wealth will find that it flies away like an eagle (Proverbs 23:5). Others who seek satisfaction will discover that no quantity fills the bottomless appetite of greed. And for those who pursue money, they will find that it corrupts their hearts and destroys their friends. Those in business must remember Solomon's observation that, as the goods grow, so do those who eat them. A healthy business is profitable, but no matter the size of the company, only a small percentage will ever represent profit after all bills are sent in and employees are paid.

For those who aspire to serve God instead, they will find their thirst quenched, their treasure secure, and everlasting good effect upon their person and character. Those who seek God will find him - he will not fly away. He satisfies the weary soul. His influence and friendship renews our hearts and blesses our relationships. The business that seeks God and serves him will find itself protected from many temptations and snares (1 Timothy 6:9).
