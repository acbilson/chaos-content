This is an overarching note that explores the theme of light as it exists from Genesis to Revelation.

Light is a pattern that begins with the first page in Genesis in reference, first to spiritual beings (and by implication, the one God), but later to humans acting as image bearers (see Moses' glowing face and the high priest's white garb). Light applies to all humans, to be sons of light, lights of the world, etc.
