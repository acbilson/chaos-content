[Letter From Jail](https://letterfromjail.com/) is a beautifully typeset rendition of Martin Luther King Jr's epislte from Birmingham jail, with a crucial and timeless analysis of justice, oppression, love and race. It is also a stunning example of a modern day epistle in the same vein as Galatians.
