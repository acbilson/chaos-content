The first renewed concept of the Sabbath for the present day came from a sermon I'd heard in Turkey from a pastor in Minnesota. He talked about drinking craft beer and cooking dinner for friends because these things brought him joy and rest. He referred to Isaiah 58:13 and called out that the Sabbath isn't only a rule about not working; it's a delight.

> If you turn back your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your pleasure on my holy day, and **call the Sabbath a delight** and the holy day of the LORD honorable; if you honor it, not going your own ways, or seeking your own pleasure, or talking idly; (_ESV_)

Children have put a sharp edge to our need for one day in seven for rest and delight. We realized with our first that we could easily live in a constant state of emergency. We had an ah-ha moment like Ben describes:

> If something like the Orthodox Sabbath seems impossibly hard, or if you try to keep it but end up breaking it every week - as my Reform Jewish family did - then you should consider that perhaps, despite the propaganda of the palliatives, you are in a permanent state of emergency. (Benquo, [Sabbath as alarm](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/HXkpm9b8o964jbQ89/p/p7hW7E3fHF3PDzErk))

We're discovering much about how actions can appear to be restful but are net-negative. I'd like to review Zvi's [hierarchy of the Shabbistic](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/HXkpm9b8o964jbQ89/p/ZoCitBiBv97WEWpX5) to glean more insights and perhaps write some of them here.

The sabbath is to time what the temple and tabernacle are to space. The sabbath is a cathedral in time. On the seventh day we experience in time what the tabernacle and temple represented as spaces which is eternal life, God in the complete creation.

## Not "Working"

To rest on the Sabbath, when the goal is not a mere removal of physical labor but an ending of business, both planning and otherwise, (see idle words in Isaiah 58), perhaps a decent measurement for "work" is this: does this activity have a purpose beyond itself, or is it done purely for its own sake? Consider Burkeman's thinking about rest:

{{< notice type=quote name="Oliver Burkeman, Four Thousand Weeks, pg. 147" >}}
The truth, then, is that spending at least some of your leisure time "wastefully," focused solely on the pleaasure of the experience, is the only way not to waste it–to be truly at leisure, rather than covertly engaged in future-focused self-improvement.

AND

{{< notice type=quote name="Oliver Burkeman, Four Thousand Weeks, pg. 158"  >}}
We might seek to incorporate into our daily lives more things we do for their own sake alone–to spend some of our time, that is, on activities in which the only thing we're trying to get from them is the doing itself.

He uses walking in the woods as an example. He's not improving his ability to walk, nor is he doing it strictly for exercise or for someone else's approbation. It isn't efficient–if he wanted to make his round-trip more efficient he'd never depart.
