Certain theological systems define conversion at a single point in an individual's life when they were {{< acronym saved "a Christian term loaded with many meanings depending upon context. Essentially, a transition from being an outsider to an insider." >}}. Identifying this moment is a crucial piece of a person's {{< acronym testimony "a Christian term which means a personal story of an encounter with God" >}}. The moment is marked by inward experience in some traditions, or an outward ritual in others. Depending on the system, the authenticity of this moment can be brought into question if the converted's life exhibits little or temporary change. In these cases, the conversion moment is nullified and must _actually_ happen in order to truly be saved.

Contrary to this system, Jesus had only one request of those he encountered, "follow me." All a person had to do to be in the "in" crowd was be near him. No miraculous event, no faith confession, no ritual, only to walk around Galilee with him, or eat dinner at one of his friend's parties, or even sneak into his home late at night.

After he taught a rag-tag bunch of men and women about his kingdom, he left the keys in their hands. Some of them didn't believe him even then, but that didn't stop him. "I am all-powerful. As you go, make disciples of all the peoples... teach them how to do all I've told you. And I will be there with you the whole time."

Jesus' treatment of his disciples fits poorly into a moment-of-conversion theology. His only requirement to discipleship is to begin following him about Galilee.

## Practices To Try

- Ask a person you've mentored in some capacity about their experience. Were they able to go and do likewise? What parts of your life with Jesus did they take on, and which did they not?
