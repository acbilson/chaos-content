Psalm 1 describes the ideal, flourishing human in this way:

{{< poetry >}}
[H]is delight is in the law of the LORD,
and on his law he meditates day and night.
{{< /poetry >}}

I feel inadequate to the task whenever I read this song. The ancients had the entire Torah memorized and their culture infused with Yahweh's instruction. My culture, even at home, is infused with much besides the words of Yahweh and my brain is not up to that monumental task (and I'm better equipped for mass memorization than most).

But what does it mean to meditate day and night?

Somewhere in a [Bible Project](https://bibleproject.com/) podcast I learned that the word translated "meditate", [hāḡâ](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/h1897/kjv/wlc/0-1/), is of a person who quietly mumbles to himself. The image is a person who demonstrates his delight in Yahweh's instruction by spending regular time reciting the words to himself out loud.
