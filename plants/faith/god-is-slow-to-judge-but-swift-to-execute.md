It's a pattern in the LORD's judgment to be long in coming but swift and complete in execution. The wickedness of those dwelling in Canaan did not bring destruction upon their heads for over four centuries, but when it was full, retribution was like the days of Noah or Sodom and Gomorrah. He offers each generation, from the time Abram walked the land until Joshua began to deliver cities over to destruction, the opportunity to repent. But it says something about human society that, after five generations (400 / 80), the culture of Canaan had become so hardened in evil that nothing but annihilation would restore the land from violence. It makes me wonder about U.S. society and what I can reasonably expect in terms of change.

For more about offering every generation the opportunity to repent, meditate on the book of Jonah.

While judgment may be swift and complete, the LORD shows mercy to individuals even in the midst of judgment because {{< backref src="/plants/faith/god-favors-mercy-over-judgment" >}}.

Jesus refers to this aspect of God's judgment in his own return:

For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
