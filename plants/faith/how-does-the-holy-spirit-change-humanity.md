The first two-thirds of the Bible's storyline is waiting breathlessly for the human who will finally be the true image of God, defeat the serpent and deal with the wake of destruction caused by human failure and foolishness. But after Jesus, the story's culminating point, the wait for a new human is over. However, the new humanity inaugurated by Jesus has many mysteries. One of these mysteries is how it will be any better than its forebears.

It seems to be a given that we who live post-Pentacost will exceed the Israelites who came before us in fulfilling our purpose as images of God. Jesus is the first human who achieves this and is therefore the first complete human example. There's also the power of the enemy; a power which Jesus has defeated, even humiliated. But there's also a new Spirit given to humans, the Spirit of God.

The Spirit of God offers communal gifts to humans. He replaces Jesus' physical presence on earth. But how the Spirit's involvement with humans, even His indwelling in us, changes the game is still mystery to me.

### Explorations

One direction to explore is the Spirit's formative work as a partner in spiritual disciplines and repentance.

Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words. And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.
