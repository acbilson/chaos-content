The first two-thirds of the Bible's storyline is waiting breathlessly for the human who will finally be the true image of God, defeat the serpent and deal with the wake of destruction caused by human failure and foolishness. But after Jesus, the story's culminating point, the wait for a new human is over. However, the new humanity inaugurated by Jesus has many mysteries. One of these mysteries is how it will be any better than its forebears.

It seems to be a given that we who live post-Pentacost will exceed the Israelites who came before us in fulfilling our purpose as images of God. Jesus is the first human who achieves this and is therefore the first complete human example. There's also the power of the enemy; a power which Jesus has defeated, even humiliated. But there's also a new Spirit given to humans, the Spirit of God.

The Spirit of God offers communal gifts to humans. He replaces Jesus' physical presence on earth. But how the Spirit's involvement with humans, even His indwelling in us, changes the game is still mystery to me.
