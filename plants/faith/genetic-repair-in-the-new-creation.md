What if the righting of the world in Jesus' return is related to genetic repair? If present in our DNA are the fragments of our ancestors, and some ancestors enjoy features which we have since lost, what would humanity be like if all or most positive features were transfused into a single body? What if a human had the smell of a bloodhound, the hearing of a dolphin, and the vision of an octopus?
