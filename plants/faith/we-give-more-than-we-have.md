Strict adherence to the adage that we can give others only what we have - a Biblical concept (see Matthew 12:35) - has overpowered two equal realities.

First, our treasure is external to us. His words and presence are not limited by the vessel’s spiritual vitality. We are not batteries that must be charged in order to emit light. Though spiritual practices are essential to all disciples, mission is not contingent or subsequent to our personal growth.

Second, even the highest quality spiritual life does not equip our community to share their treasure. Sharing Jesus, fraught with mistakes, leads to experience. Experience, fostered in community with story and reflection, produces disciples. Disciples who can pass to their neighbors what they’re learning makes disciple-making disciples. And disciple-making disciples spark movements and revival.
