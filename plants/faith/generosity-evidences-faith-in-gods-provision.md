**Giving is evidence of faith.**

Those who place their trust in Jesus to pardon them on the day of judgment must place that same trust in him to provide for their basic needs. It won't do to say, "Jesus will rescue me from future judgment," while one's current attitude is "I must rescue myself from poverty and need." Might it be possible that those who will not rely upon Jesus to save them in the present age may demonstrate that they have no real faith in Jesus' salvation at the judgment? It is, therefore, more than a matter of habit to give; giving is evidence of the presence, or absence, of faith in Jesus.

Does the Lord treat corporations as single entities, able to break God's law itself, or does he only deal with the individuals who make up the corporation? The judgments of God against nations indicates the former.

When the southern kingdom of Judah was sent into Babylonian captivity, it was not because every individual had turned from God. After all, the prophets who wrote about Judah's last days also went into captivity! Other indications, such as the faith of Daniel and his friends, present a picture of a mixed-faith Judah sent into captivity as one community. However, when the Lord speaks about the coming earthly judgment, he indicates that the leaders, rather than a certain percentage of the total, are those who bring judgment on the entire community.

If we apply this to a corporation of one thousand people, two important points arise regarding money. First, the corporation as a whole may be judged by the Lord, though individuals have not departed from his ways. Second, God looks most carefully at the leaders, rather than the general population, when deciding that judgment is ripe.

Anderson's direct applications of the command to tithe seems oversimplified. The reference to Matthew 23:23 has the Pharisees tithing even the growth of their spice plants, and if Jesus' response is that we ought to do likewise, it means setting aside ten percent of _every_ gain, not remunerative gain alone! Still, his direct approach is well taken; there's no avoiding God's direction when it comes to giving a tenth ({{< cite name=Anderson >}}).

How do I apply this as a business leader? First, by valuing God's command enough to do it in my personal life. No one at work needs to know, but I must give ten percent of my income away in obedience to God. Not only is this his command, it is also a benefit to myself because I'm freed from relying on my own wisdom or cunning to gain wealth. Second, by offering the opportunity for others to give. When Paul traveled to the places he'd spread the good news, he also gathered a gift for the church in Jerusalem. He told them of the opportunity to give before he arrived, and he encouraged them to give when he got there. He even told some churches how others had given in order to spur them on to give more!
