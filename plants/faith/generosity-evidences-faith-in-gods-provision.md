Those who place their trust in Jesus to pardon them on the day of judgment must place that same trust in him to provide for their basic needs today. It won't do to say, "Jesus will rescue me from future judgment," while one's current attitude is "I must rescue myself from poverty and need." Might it be possible that those who will not rely upon Jesus to save them in the present age demonstrate that they have no real faith in Jesus' salvation at the judgment? It is, therefore, more than a matter of habit to give; giving is evidence of the presence, or absence, of faith in Jesus.
