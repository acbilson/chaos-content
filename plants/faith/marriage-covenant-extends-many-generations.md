It was invaluable to learn six years ago that Amie and I would change so much it’d be [like marrying a different person](https://timothykeller.com/books/the-meaning-of-marriage). But when I committed myself to Amie on July 12, 2014, I didn’t realize I was binding myself to her and also to all who come after. The marriage covenant is more like the LORD’s covenant with Abraham than I realized. It extends to all generations.
