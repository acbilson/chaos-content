It didn't occur to me until reading [Matt Webb's musings](https://interconnected.org/home/2023/01/17/filtered), but sometimes direct restitution is insufficient for true justice.

Webb quotes a 1917 paper by Walter W. Hyde called [The Prosecution of Lifeless Things and Animals in Greek Law: Part I](https://www.jstor.org/stable/289180#metadata_info_tab_contents) to make his case that Greeks felt that, even if the perpetrator of a crime could not be brougt to justice, the community still required purification from the offense.

For the idea was that, in case of a murder, not only a crime had been committed, but also a pollution had been caused in the community and some person or thing was to blame and must be punished to rid the state of defilement.

Even before I saw that Hyde mentions a Semitic correlation, I remembered a recent [Bible Project podcast](https://bibleproject.com/podcast/purity-and-impurity-leviticus/) that explores the same dual concept in Levitical sacrifices. Worth a further exploration I think.
