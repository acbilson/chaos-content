This is an incomplete list of maxims I've gleaned while working on Angular/RxJS development.

RxJS has a reputation for being complex, hard to understand, and hard to use. A deserved reputation, to be honest. I’ve used RxJS in a project to great effect, it made an impossible problem possible, but getting your head around it isn’t trivial. It’s a great tool when you need it. Which is hopefully not that often.
