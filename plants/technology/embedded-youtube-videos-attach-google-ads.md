I know that I shouldn't be surprised at this point, but adding Matthew's video to my ship's log also inadvertently added a Google Ad tracker to my website (pun intended). It's in Matthew's best interest that I leave the video on my site, but maybe there's a way I can embed it that _doesn't_ send my visitor's information to Google?
