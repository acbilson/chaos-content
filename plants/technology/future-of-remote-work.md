My personality leans towards the “don’t bother me, I’m getting \*\*\*\* done” at times, but Sean makes clear a few hard truths about a remote work future:

1. Wage depression. If my software engineer job can be done by anyone on the earth with my skills, why should I be paid $100,000 when the Malay will do it for $75,000?

2. Forgotten. I witnessed this months after taking a remote worker in at Relativity. Kevin was one of our best, but no one saw his contributions and promoted him.

3. Broken direction. It’s hard enough getting everyone to pull in the same direction at a large company. Take that company remote? Nigh impossible. (unproven, but imaginable)

4. No mentorship. Similar to point 2. I have actually gained significantly from remote colleague mentorship but it requires an intentionality that’s not needed in an office.

5. Assumptions. This is big. Do you want a fluid lifestyle where all time might be work time? Do you have a dedicated work space? Do you have reliable childcare?

5. Working through sickness. Anne Petersen writes a [persuasive article](https://annehelen.substack.com/p/the-normalization-of-working-through) that remote work has driven people to work even through horrific illness.

Thanks for your [thoughts](https://www.seanblanda.com/our-remote-work-future-is-going-to-suck/) Sean, especially the correlation between American steelworkers and future knowledge workers in point 1.
