How does one build an interoperable ecosystem of personal (or communal) applications? Impressed by Linus Lee's [enormous ecosystem](https://github.com/thesephist), I emailed him with my own questions about underlying data structures. He pointed me to an invaluable article by Gordon Brander, [if headers did not exist, it would be necessary to invent them](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/if-headers-did-not-exist-it-would?s=r). Linus summarizes:

{{< notice type=quote name="Linus Lee" >}}
The basic idea is that documents and entities are key-value pairs, with a few "blessed" keys that are universal and an open space for other keys to become used by specific use cases. I think this is a good way to reduce coupling between apps and data sources while letting systems interact.

The file format Gordon recommends is quite similar to Hugo's Markdown with header metadata. So similar, in fact, that there's little reason not to use the same format. While I could opt for only a TOML/YAML file, the body text grants powerful variability. Later in Linus' email he writes:

{{< notice type=quote name="Linus Lee" >}}
For example, contact cards may have specific fields for name, phone number, etc. But maybe in its "body text" field the same info is mentioned again in a less structured way, so that universal tools that only know about the "body text" column (like a search engine) can still make some sense of the entity without having to know about every entity type in the system.

I do appreciate the structure of a backend SQLite table, and a JSON-formatted column can accomplish nearly the same result as a header, but nothing beats the convenience of opening a plain-text file and making edits in Vim. As Gordon notes, the structure of a database naturally results in a plethora of bespoke APIs that get increasingly difficult to manage.

{{< notice type=quote name="Gordon Brander" src="https://subconscious.substack.com/p/composability-with-other-tools?s=r" >}}
On the web, the most common way to save data is in a database hidden behind a server. This makes interoperability an explicit feature that must be implemented through APIs. The default is for web apps not to interoperate... Rather than implementing each otherâ€™s bespoke APIs, apps can collaborate over a shared file type, cutting down the necessary integrations from n * (n-1), to just n.

There is one piece that the IndieWeb movement adds to this concept that I think is worth further exploration. While everything Gordon says about file format interoperability is true, and a database with an API layer does not enable the same degree of interoperability, the web itself is in a structured file format: HTML. With a bit of attention to shared conventions, a web page itself can supply a flexible interface for equal interoperability to a file format. If a tool renders HTML instead of a JSON API, many tools can read and understand the files returned from the web server. The backend data structure is less relevant when the output is a file format.

Thanks so much to Linus for the link to Gordon's article and the insight about loosely-coupled data sources!
