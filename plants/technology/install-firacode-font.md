Every once in a while I discover a visual tweak to my software programming work that makes me wonder how I ever lived without it. For example, Victoria's post on [technical ergonomics](https://victoria.dev/blog/technical-ergonomics-for-the-efficient-developer/) is a great source for delightful tools.

In the same vein, the [FiraCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Installing) font is an aesthetic masterpiece. While it's hard to measure, my sense is that the intuitive gliphs have reduced my mistakes by making my code easier to read. Even if it wasn't true, everything is more fun to read!
