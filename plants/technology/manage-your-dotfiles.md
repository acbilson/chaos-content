Thanks to Evan Hahn for his [Decade of Dotfiles](https://evanhahn.com/a-decade-of-dotfiles/), I was inspired to clean up my own dotfiles. His suggestion for [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) was particularly helpful. You can review my dotfile configurations [here](https://github.com/acbilson/config).
