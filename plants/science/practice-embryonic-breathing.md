Embryonic breathing is a Qigong practice: Qi (chi/energy) and gong (kung/practice which takes great energy and time to master). Was originally two characters translated “no heat” and “water rice” because first “no heat” describes peace (where to have heat was to be out-of-balance) and second “water rice” describes the sources of energy to the human body.

The practice of Taiji (Tai Chi) and Qigong have similar aims. While Qigong can span from intense physical activity to motionless meditation, it typically falls in the middle, as does Taiji. Finding a means to bring the body into harmony by physical motion, dancing, walking, etc. and mental exercise (meditation, breathing exercises) are of equal importance in the Qigong framework because they achieve the same ultimate goal.

Embryonic Breathing is a subset of Qigong called Nei Dan (Internal Elixir).

### Steps

1. locate the Upper Dan Tian (brain) and Real Lower Dan Tian (upper intestine).
2. condense the spirit to a higher level of focus (produce more Qi).
3. lead Shen (Spirit) and Qi (energy) to their residences.
4. unite Shen and Qi at Real Lower Dan Tian to store Qi in abundance.

In order to build up the Qi and store it internally, you must first have a deep and profound feeling which allows your mind to reach the deep places of your body. You should know that _feeling is the language by which your mind and body communicate_. Therefore, to improve the communication ability, your feeling of your physical body and Qi body must reach a high level.

Much of the research on the body's electrical field relates to acupuncture. For example, Dr. Becker reports that the conductivity of the skin is much higher at acupuncture cavities, and that it is now possible to locate them prcisely by measuring the skin's conductivity. Many of these reports prove that the acupuncture which has been done in China for thousands of years is reasonable and scientific.
