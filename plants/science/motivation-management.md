Having a conversation with ChatGPT 4.0 about setting 2024 goals yielded this [article about motivation](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/finding-new-home/202201/how-increase-self-motivation). A couple points stand out.

First, that motivation is highest at the beginning and end of a goal. This matches exactly with my 2023 exercise and memorization goals. I sustained motivation for the first three months until I was sidelined with a bout of sickness and the scheduling challenges of regular summer visitors. As the summer has waned and our visitors slow, my desire to return to these habits has increased. Mr. Emamzadeh's suggests limiting the size of the middle period by reducing the goal's time. A yearly exercise goal might be broken into quarters, months, or even weeks.

Second, destinguish between goals that are means vs. ends. Mr. Emamzadeh gives an example of a goal to buy a special gift (end), vs a goal of finding parking (means). When the goal is ultimate it is also more motivating. I'd add that goals to an end also foster creativity since they allow for multiple means.
