TODO: find a good definition for what trade *IS*, then rename this post.

{{< notice type=quote src="https://worldspiritsockpuppet.substack.com/p/we-dont-trade-with-ants" name="Katja Grace" >}}
the classic cognitive error of imagining that trade is about swapping fixed-value objects, rather than creating new value from a confluence of one’s needs and the other’s affordances. It’s only in the imaginary zero-sum world that you can generally replace trade with stealing the other party’s stuff, if the other party is weak enough.
