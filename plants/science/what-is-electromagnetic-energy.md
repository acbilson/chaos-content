I had not considered that heat radiance, such as that put forth by my space heater, is a form of energy in exactly the same way as light and Wi-Fi. I seem to have the same view of the world which existed before the 1980's.

For a long time, people were confused about just what type of energy was circulating in our bodies. Many people believed that it was heat, others considered it to be electricity, and many others assumed it was a mixture of heat, electricity, and light.<br /><br />
This confusion lasted until the early 1980â€™s, when the concept of Qi gradually became clear. If we think carefully about what we know from science today, we can see that (except possibly for gravity) there is actually only one type of energy in this universe, and that is electromagnetic energy (electromagnetic waves).

NASA supplies a helpful visualization of this energy in their [Introduction to the Electromagnetic Spectrum](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/01_intro). There is much, much more to learn about the subject, but NASA again has a brief overview in the [Anatomy of an Electromagnetic Wave](https://science.nasa.gov/ems/02_anatomy).
