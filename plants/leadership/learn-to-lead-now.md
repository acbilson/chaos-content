**Future leaders serve as though they were already in their future role.**

"So, you want to be a leader?" the manager says to his subordinate.

"Yes," the subordinate replies, "I've been working here for five years now, I'm the best at what I do, and I think it's about time I should be given a promotion."

"A promotion?" the manager responds. "You're a dependable programmer, I'll give you that. And you have worked here five years. Tell me, what have you done to prepare yourself to be a leader? Have you taken any courses, or attended seminars?"

"Of course not," the subordinate scoffs, "I'm not a leader yet!"

Does this sound familiar? It probably does since, if you haven't heard it from others, you've thought it yourself. There's just enough truth to the temptation to make it effective. It is true that those who are faithful in a little will be given much (_ESV_, Matthew 25:21). But the subordinate, like many of us, relies on his past efforts to gain what he wants in the future. He discounts preparation and, lacking that, proves he does not want the position of service; he only wants the title's honor.

Does an entrepreneur want to serve his customers, or does he want fame and riches? Does he obey the LORD and prepare (_ESV_, ), or does he rush ahead with his own plans? Show me what he's doing right now and I will tell you.

An entrepreneur who, before he's even built the first product or defined the first service, sets out to improve other's lives will make a successful entrepreneur one day. He prepares himself for what his future role will entail: the service of his customer base. The entrepreneur who invents and designs products with the vision of his name on the cover of Forbes magazine will ultimately fall apart. His business, if he's truly hit upon a customer need, may survive, but he will soon be beyond his leadership depth and drown in his own pride.

This chapter strikes home. Do I believe that I will hold a position of future leadership? Like the subordinate, I capitulate to the temptation that, in time, I will earn the right to be a recognized leader. Instead of believing and preparing I slip into a holding pattern; waiting without action. If I believe that my future entails leading people, my next step is to prepare as though it were going to happen soon, perhaps three months from now.

I enrolled in this MBA program to prepare for business leadership. It has kept me thinking, writing, and applying leadership principles at work and at home. But I feel dissonance between my current work position and the principles I'm learning. I thought this dissonance was caused by learning about leadership but not being in the leadership role I aspire to.  Anderson's observation gives me courage to push forward in preparation now, expecting what I do today will pay off in tomorrow's leadership,

  "A life marked by depth and steeped in preparation can only be cultivated in protracted periods of feeling like you're in "no man's land" and getting nowhere fast. Cherish these times, because in them you plant and cultivate the seeds that position you for your next leadership harvest ({{< cite name=Anderson loc="pg. 29" >}})."
