**Leaders give up more and more of what they have to succeed.**

To become a leader takes sacrifice. But many believe the sacrifice is a one-time cost and the privilege of leadership worth the price. For some, the cost is a graduate-level degree program. To others, it's extra hours on the clock to become a star employee who deserves promotion. Others see the cost as family vs. career and choose to forgo a family for a while in order to be a leader in their industry. All of these people will be disappointed to find that privileges of leadership: the authority, connections and knowledge, are not purchased by one sacrifice at the start of their leadership. Instead, everyone must regularly sacrifice more to maintain and grow as leaders ({{< cite name=Maxwell >}}).

A leader loses rights that he would have if he weren't leading. He loses control of his schedule to be available for those who follow him. He loses his choice to do what he wants in favor of what's best for his followers. The more successful he wants to be, the more of his rights he must give up. He doesn't merely sacrifice in the workplace either; he often must sacrifice at work, then turn around and make another sacrifice when he arrives at home with his family.

A leader who believes the sacrifice ends will eventually become disillusioned and cynical. If leadership is viewed as a reward for sacrifice instead of a pathway down into deeper sacrifice, when the reward doesn't materialize or is taken away the leader will feel cheated and robbed. For this reason, it is imperative that leaders know what they are willing to sacrifice to be the successful leaders they aspire to, and they must recognize that these first sacrifices are only the first mile markers down the winding path and that, in time, they must again ask themselves what they will sacrifice to continue the journey. A wise leader who recognized that their sacrifice continues will not be easily discouraged when more must be given up to lead.

What am I willing to sacrifice at this season? The heaviest sacrifice I wrestle with today is the death of my choice to decide what I will do any given day. Yes, I have read many books about priorities and practiced many familiar exercises to be intentional and proactive with the time given me. As my responsibilities grow at home and at work; however, I find that the list of things I _must_ do often leaves little room to do whatever else I might _want_ to do. I have the same number of hours in my day as ever, but the demand on my time is ever greater. I may choose to push aside my responsibilities and do what I want, but there are always consequences. This applies not only to the immediate requests of others - "help me with this?" "would you get this done?" "will you do this for me?" - but even the short times I am alone. For I can choose to take actions that restore my mind and heart; actions that I find surprisingly difficult to choose in the moment; or I can choose whatever I want at the time. But the restorative acts, those which I do primarily to be ready to serve again, are the path to successful leadership.
