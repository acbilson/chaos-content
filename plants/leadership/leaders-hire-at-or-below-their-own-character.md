**Leaders hire at or below their own character.**

The cost to develop skills in a person with sterling character and energizing passion is minimal compared with the drain from a skilled worker with flawed character and little passion. Even were this common knowledge among hiring managers, the information alone is insufficient to change hiring strategies. This is because people don't hire character that goes beyond their own attainments.

Many potential reasons for this exist. Pride keeps managers from hiring those with stronger character lest they are shown up by the example of another. A difference in worldview may be another, for one who denies external truth will have a more difficult time appreciating Anderson's no-compromise attitude about lying (though that's not to say truth isn't important to such a person in his own way). Fear also motivates managers to find employees who are weaker than himself so he may remain in authority.

Books abound that describe the 'perfect' employee, but no business will rise above the level of its leadership. An entrepreneur won't draw employees who exhibit the character qualities his business must have without also possessing these qualities himself. Even if this is done, the entrepreneur must also be wary of pride and fear in himself and his leaders, lest his emotions result in hiring workers with lesser character.

This may be Anderson's most direct and cutting chapter. He holds back none of his sentiment about the people who don't hold his values and performance standards, calling them "the ranks of morons, misfits, [and] moochers," and describing a team composed of these as "laughable ({{< cite name=Anderson loc="pg. 204" >}})." While I rankle at his word choice, I'm reminded that Jesus said difficult things about people too, such as "let them alone; they are blind guides. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit (ESV, Matthew 15:14)."

When I read this chapter, my inclination is to place myself with the "morons, misfits, [and] moochers." The purpose of this chapter is clear, to write about building a team, but it assumes the character of the leader has no character flaws. When Anderson does turn the spotlight on the leader, it's to highlight that pride and selfishness may limit the team's effectiveness, but any other flaw would demand automatic removal from leadership in his organization, if not termination of employment. Anderson can get away with this if his character is as strong as his description, but another leader without the same character never will.

My takeaway is to develop character in myself first, then hire others.
