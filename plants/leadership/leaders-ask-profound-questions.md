**Quality questions are pivotal for a strong organizational culture.**

Questions are the life-blood of a healthy organizational culture.  A culture of questions flips the corporate hierarchy on its head by empowering subordinates to add their expertise to conversations at the top.  Such a culture makes it possible for leaders to investigate the reasons behind events and processes without raising the hackles of their direct reports. Leaders, far from being thought incompetent, prove their competence by asking good questions. As Solomon wrote, "a fool takes no pleasure in understanding, but only in expressing his opinion (_ESV_, Proverbs 18:2)." In many ways, a questioning culture is a vital culture.

A culture of questioning is half-way, but the questions must be quality. Bobb Biehl points out, "If you ask profound questions...you get profound answers. If you ask shallow questions, you get shallow answers. If you ask no questions, you get no answers at all (Referenced by {{< cite name=Marquardt loc="pg. 39" >}})." It's possible to have a culture with the appearance of questioning but a lack of quality. "Shallow" questions may be the primary form or even questions that foster blame and defensive behavior. Therefore, questions are vital, and their quality is vital.

Inertia in a business tends towards stability and structure. Change is uncomfortable and risky, and requires those involved to examine themselves, the work they've done so far, and all the processes that used to serve them well; even that they are proud of. A poorly worded question can feel like a personal attack or a statement of blame. It's not enough for a business leader to incorporate more questions into his routine then, but to begin and end with questions for himself. From self-reflection, he may craft questions both broad and narrow, profound and simple, open and closed - as the situation demands - to get to the bottom of problems and enlist other's minds and hearts in search of a mutual solution. This type of questioning is work, no getting around it, but the benefits stretch far beyond the single-minded answers of a fool.

Questioning is my favorite mode, my go-to when I'm challenged, and my best skill. Marquardt challenges me by showing that questions aren't all equal and that the best questions are crafted from genuine curiosity and a humble spirit. It occurs to me that I'd find answers faster (and more problems to explore) if I became better at crafting questions. And to develop better questions I must practice self-reflection. Perhaps I'd have more spiritual conversations too if I discovered more profound questions to ask than "How are you doing?"
