While applicants are assessed for competency, employees prefer integrity over skill in their colleagues.

This insight is evident from personal experience, but [research](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/3318/research-people-prefer-friendliness-trustworthiness-in-teammates-over-skill-competency) into the use of challenging and supportive voice conducted at Binghampton University may shed more light.
