**Leadership opportunities come to those who connect with others.**

Maxwell spends three-quarters of every day connecting with people because, the stronger the connection, the more opportunity to lead {{< cite name=Maxwell loc="pg. 166" >}}.

When Absalom stole the kingdom from his father David, he did so by connecting one-on-one with the nation (2Sa15).  Although his desire was corrupt, the pains he took to ingratiate himself with individuals shows how powerful connection can be.  So, though it took forty years, Absalom was able to steal the hearts of all the Israelite people, and he did it under one of Israel's greatest kings!

## Importance

An entrepreneur may humbly acknowledge his dependence on others to execute his vision and yet never start because no one is following.  He may identify the people who could make his business a success, but until he connects with them and shows his personal investment, they may only remain at a distance.  Those in whom he has invested, however, are closer than ever to joining his cause.

## Application

When I consider leadership, I often think of the proverb quoted by Maxwell, "He who thinketh he leadeth but hath no one following only taketh a walk {{< cite name=Maxwell loc="pg. 128" >}}."  I look behind me, see no one following, and assume leadership is still a ways off.  Absalom's example shows that, whether for nefarious purposes or not, a person who makes genuine efforts to connect and serve people will end up with followers.  In light of this, I want to think carefully about who I would want on a future business team and how I might serve them, with the intention that they would join my team.

### DMM Application

A person of peace needs to be the type of person who knows and believes that connection is a key part of leadership.  In order to multiply church communities there must be leaders who are willing to gain influence, not through a title, a birthright, or otherwise, but through connection.  This is how a leader is recognized-through his or her network of followers-and this is how a leader is upheld.
