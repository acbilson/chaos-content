This paper written about [Capitalism and Extreme Poverty](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X22002169) shows that a common narrative, that one of Capitalism's greatest achievements has been to raise people out of poverty, is patently false. It's very detailed, but the abstract is easy enough to read and the charts help a lot.
