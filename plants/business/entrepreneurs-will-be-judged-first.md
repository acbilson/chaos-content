**The corruption of justice is abhorrent to the LORD.**

> "[Jehoshaphat] appointed judges in the land in all the fortified cities of Judah, city by city, and said to the judges, 'Consider what you do, for you judge not for man but for the LORD. He is with you in giving judgment. Now then, let the fear of the LORD be upon you. Be careful what you do, for there is no injustice with the LORD our God, or partiality or taking bribes' (_ESV_, 2 Chronicles 19:5-7)."

Jehoshaphat's reign wasn't stellar, but he did begin after the death of Ahab with reforms to bring people back to the LORD. Primarily, Jehoshaphat appointed leaders, and the first leaders he appointed were judges. His charge to them was solemn; the judges were to act with the same gravity as though their judgments were on trial by the LORD. This was a weighty responsibility, as their judgment was backed, not by their personal status or that of the king, but by the LORD himself. If the judges judgment was corrupted; however, they would be first to be judged.

Entrepreneurs are in a position to judge their employees. When the entrepreneur judges fairly, her employees feel safe that negative behavior will be addressed and good performance rewarded. When an entrepreneur judges with partiality, employees lose their sense of safety and can develop resentment towards the entrepreneur and those the entrepreneur favors above the rest. Worse yet, entrepreneurs, like judges, are held to a higher standard by the LORD because of their influence over the lives of their employees. When an entrepreneur acts unjustly, she may expect the LORD to judge her first and most directly. Let entrepreneurs fear the LORD, lest they be tempted to use their position for dishonest gain instead of just dealing.
