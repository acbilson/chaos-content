**Fill one's business with good things, and good fruit will be the result.**

> “No good tree bears bad fruit, nor does a bad tree bear good fruit. Each tree is recognized by its own fruit.
    People do not pick figs from thornbushes, or grapes from briers.
    A good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart, and an evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart. For the mouth speaks what the heart is full of.”
   (_NIV_, Luke 6:43-45)

When a business produces bad fruit - a financial scandal, poor customer service, a faulty product - you can be assured there's a deeper problem. Likewise, when a business delivers quality bookkeeping, excellent customer service, or a superior product, behind that outward expression is a sound, healthy company.

Therefore, it's best to fertilize the tree of your business with good rather than evil. Denigrate competitors and you feed your company evil and will produce evil fruit. Respect your competitors and you will reap a harvest of kindness and appropriate competition. Communicate appreciation for the diversity of your company and you will produce even greater diversity; complain about those different and you will grow replicas of yourself.
