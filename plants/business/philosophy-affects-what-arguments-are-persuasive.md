**A person's intellectual background shapes what arguments persuade them.**

Of the facets which comprise a person's culture, the philosophy of knowledge most shapes the style of argument likely to influence that person. English citizens were comprehensively shaped by the modernization of Aristotle's "application-first" thinking by the English philosophers of the 13th and 16th centuries ({{< cite name=Meyer loc="pg. 97" >}}). Across the English channel, Descartes instituted an opposing philosophy of thought characterized by "principles-first" thinking which reigns among European nations to this day. These styles of thought acquire value and meaning within the cultures they exist in beyond the bare order of deduction. A French woman will not merely note that an English man is applying an "application-first" approach to their conclusion - she will be offended that the Englishman believes she's so ignorant as to accept his premises without a foundation of data and logic!

While "to sell is human" ({{< cite name=Pink >}}), the approach we use and the style that most influences us originates from our culture rather than our common humanity. Sales people who treat each sales target the same are ineffective; the best sales people are those who learn who they are selling to. Nonetheless, people invariably land in situations where little opportunity exists to learn about the audience directly, and this is when an understanding of the audience's culture can determine the success or failure of a person's pitch. A German man who sells his ideas to an American firm had better cut down his presentation on the flight over. If he doesn't lead with a terse summary of his proposal, he's apt to lose the audience before they've even heard his ideas.

Cultural insights, like Asimov's psychohistory, can predict the behavior of the masses but break down when applied to individuals. My own self supplies an example. A champion for the "get to the point" culture of American thinking, nevertheless I balk at any direction which lacks a reasoned and logical explanation. Decisions I make are reasoned out from principles and then applied. But if you read my work communication, you'll find the main point in the first short paragraph. What you won't see; however, is that I arrive at that short paragraph _after_ finishing the body of the email. When I sell to a crowd of people from a common cultural background, insights about their style of thinking may help me close the deal. When it's only a small group or individual, inquisitive methods are superior.
