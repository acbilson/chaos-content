**All communication benefits from eloquence.**

Although the title suggests sales pitches are the only target, McGowan's book "Pitch Perfect" applies to a wide range of communication types. Presentations and interviews are listed, but so are speeches, business meetings, one-on-one conversations, and Q&A sessions. His seven principles of eloquence shape both impromptu speeches and carefully executed announcements {{< cite name=Mcgowan >}}.

Due to the universal need for eloquence, each principle may be honed any number of ways. From tomorrow's morning stand-up to an answer to your wife's "How was your day?," each one can be intentionally developed no matter one's role. If you become a master at illustrating your entire day in a vivid story, your Scorsese skills will be invaluable to the next business presentation you give.

## Importance

In the chaos of a startup, communication skills are rarely the first topic of growth. The value of eloquence in a sales pitch is evident, but the rapid transition of one's product in a lean startup can mean weekly changes to the original pitch, while trying to: build an MVP, organize a budget, acquire customers, buy groceries, and repair the car. It's good news that an entrepreneur needn't wait until the day of reckoning to melt down the essence of his product into a Tabasco headline and a savory paragraph. He can sharpen those skills in the kitchen, writing recipe reviews or sharing tips with friends.

## Application

Charisma is composed primarily of eloquence. To share the meat of one's convictions with vivid storytelling can move people to action. Jesus was a master communicator who weaved stories, punchlines, convictions and mysteries together in a beautiful tapestry. When I compose a letter to a friend, draft the outline of a presentation, role-play a hard conversation, or share my day with Amie, McGowan's principles can guide the content and the delivery of my message and, when the time comes to deliver actual sales pitches I will have far less ground to cover than if I'd never attempted to develop eloquence before.
