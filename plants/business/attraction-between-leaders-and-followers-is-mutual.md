**Attraction between leaders and followers is mutual.**

People who follow a leader don't do so because it's against their best interests, they do so because they expect that good will come to them as a result.  Likewise, leaders don't accept followers merely because they show up, but because they see the value they add to their team.  When the leader shares his vision, the people who follow are those who want to go there or who value that path.  Likewise, the leader wants followers who will make possible the achievement of his vision.  From mutual vision comes mutual expectations, mutual contribution, and mutual commitment {{< cite name=Maxwell loc="pg. 140-141" >}}.

## Importance

Leaders need to be aware why people are attracted to them.  If they're clueless about why people have joined their organization or believe it's simply because they serve the best snacks, they will constantly disconnect with their followers and experience high turnover if not total abandonment when the reason people follow disappears.  However, when leaders see their vision and purpose as a way to improve the lives of those who follow, they are more likely to keep magnetizing them to the company's vision and draw more like-minded people to themselves.

McGregor's theories of management shed light on the importance of this insight.  In Theory X, the leader believes that those who work for him are "ultimately lazy, dislike working, and will get away with doing as little as possible {{< cite name=Miller loc="pg. 345" >}}."  Such a leader assumes the reason people are there is to collect pay and benefits, not because they are attracted to the leader's vision.  Conversely, in Theory Y, the leader believes those who work "have untapped talents and creativity, often enjoy their work, and are capable of self-control and self-direction {{< cite name=Miller loc="pg. 345" >}}."  These leaders believe it's the person's choice to work there, that they enjoy it, and that they are attracted to the vision and to benefits that extend beyond the financial.

## Application

This insight hits home with me.  At times I lose sight of my vision and with it any grasp on why others follow me.  When I can't see why they follow, I begin to fear they will stop following and have been tempted to resort to manipulation.  When I can see clearly that it's a mutually beneficial relationship, I don't experience a need to control and can confidently share my vision.  My regular fear that I've nothing to offer also hinders me from attracting others since I don't share a vision or believe that any good could come from following me.  This only solidifies Maxwell's following insight, that "if you desire to do great things with your life, then seek to become a better person and a better leader {{< cite name=Maxwell loc="pg. 145" >}}."  The limitations on those I'm able to attract centers on the weaknesses present in myself, chiefly fear.  Therefore I will focus my attention on removing fear and developing sound character in order to attract people to my vision.

### DMM Application

The DMM style of disciple-making would be severely hindered by controlling fear.  When spiritual leaders think of their followers like McGregor's Theory X, they are likely to create the attitudes and behavior they expect.  This would shut down any hope of raising new leadership and a rapid expansion of active follower of Jesus.  Therefore an important key is the perspective of the DMM practitioner, that they perceive those who begin to follow Jesus as self-motivated and willing laborers in God's kingdom.
