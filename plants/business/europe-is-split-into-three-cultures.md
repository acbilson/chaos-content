**Cultural Insight:** Europe is more culturally diverse than it might appear from a world map.

With the exception of America, the melting pot of the earth, one may consider cultures to spread across the globe in a predictable manner; pools of culture that ebb and flow like the ocean.  Natural boundaries act as the ocean's shores, eroded by influence or violent action over the years but generally unchanged.  A review of the European continent, when taken from this perspective, would lead the spectator to assume the entire small continent, stretching from Portugal to Ukraine, would share the same cultural distinctions.  This assumption couldn't be more wrong.

Instead of cultural unity, we find the European region divided into three cultural groups.  Following the French border, with a shortcut through the center of Switzerland, then around the border of Italy - all this to its south-western corner in Portugal shares a similar culture.  A second group, starting on the far side of the French border, encompassing the other half of Switzerland, the whole of Austria, and as far as the border of Denmark, comprises another culture entirely.  The third takes the rest of Eastern Europe, with a thick Czech finger stretching into German territory.

## Importance

Livermore's analysis breaks the European nations into three major divisions - Southwestern Europe, Central Europe, and Eastern Europe ({{< cite name=Livermore loc="Chapters 3-5" >}}).  While these categories may share a modicum of cultural values, a review of modern history demonstrates these groups have not always stood united.  In WWI, for example, the culturally similar France and Italy fought against one another, while Spain remained neutral.  It is notable that Switzerland, which Livermore split into two cultures, fought against neither side.  The Germanic culture prior to WWI likely spread further east than it does today.

## Application

A world map is insufficient to understand the cultural boundaries of a collection of nations.  Still, cultural similarities do ebb and flow along international borders and, with the help of history, can paint a picture of cultural oceans.  An entrepreneur who wants to launch their company in Europe would be wise to consider, not only the cultural values of the political nation in which he begins but also the macro-culture of the region.

For example, if I were to start a cell phone manufacturing company in Germany along the Rhine, which borders France, it would be a mistake to think I should be able to start a second factory on the opposing shore.  Regulatory differences aside, the opposing cultural views about work and authority alone would certainly lead to tremendous conflict.  Despite the European region being relativity small, its diversity makes every border a potential zone of contention.
