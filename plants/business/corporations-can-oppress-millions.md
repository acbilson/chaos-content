While I lean towards a positive view of business, I don't need to look far to discover countless ways that corporations oppress humans. For every piece of software that improves human life there are {{< backref src="/plants/business/most-software-oppresses-humans" name="ten that degrade it" >}}. A visit to the grocery store is a weekly reminder that {{< backref src="/plants/business/most-grocery-stores-are-dehumanizing" >}}.

Americans have an odd relationship to this reality. Our history textbooks generally associate corporations with progress, innovation, and growth, while most of the negative features: slavery, colonialism, and war, are associated with governments, often just a leader. There's a dark period in the industrial revolution, but that stain only serves to ingrain gratitude in our "enlighted" modern corporations.
