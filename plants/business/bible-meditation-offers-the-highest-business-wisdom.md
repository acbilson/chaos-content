> "Oh, how I love your law!
   I meditate on it all day long.
   Your commands are always with me and make me wiser than my enemies.
   I have more insight than all my teachers, for I meditate on your statutes.
   I have more understanding than the elders, for I obey your precepts.
   I have kept my feet from every evil path so that I might obey your word.
   I have not departed from your laws, for you yourself have taught me.
   How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
   I gain understanding from your precepts; therefore I hate every wrong path."
   (_NIV_, Psalm 119:97â€“104)

David's entire 119th psalm exalts God's Law over and over again. He starts this portion with an exclamation of love towards the directions of God. Then he raises the benefits with increasingly stunning statements. First, the possession and knowledge of God's Law gives him wisdom his enemies don't possess. God's law gives him an advantage over those who don't know it or obey it. Second, he has deeper insight than those who teach him because of the way he absorbs God's Law. Quite a statement, to have greater insight than those who excel you in knowledge! Finally, and most surprisingly, his understanding excels the elders, the most knowledgeable and respected members of society, because he puts God's Law into practice. Obedience to the Law of God brings greater understanding than either knowledge or experience, no matter how comprehensive.

David's claims apply directly to business. To have access to the wealth of God's Word gives me a source of wisdom that exceeds that of every business book my opponents may read. To memorize and think upon God's Word transforms my perspective more than the instruction of any professor or business leader. And to put into practice what I find in God's Word surpasses mastery of the practices of the most respected and successful business leaders. Finally, many books claim to supply advantageous insights, but few authors promise to come and teach what they've written to the reader. God's investment in business is not removed, as though he supplies the list of instructions for wise business and then watches from afar as I struggle to steadily apply them; he himself knows the value of my obedience and helps me turn again and again to His Word and teaches me how to obey it.
