**Short interpersonal connections make work a better place to be.**

Although the man who spent 27 years alone in the wilderness may not agree, ([Finkel](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/mar/15/stranger-in-the-woods-christopher-knight-hermit-maine)) humans were made to connect with one another.  Cultures vary widely on the relevance of this fact, from those who require personal connections prior to business transactions to those single-minded in getting the job done.  Nevertheless, every culture recognizes a need for a connection with others when conducting business.

When a leader connects on a personal level with his direct reports the opportunity to know them is made.  With knowing them comes the insight needed to assist them well and to give them work they'll excel at.

## Importance

In the rush to accomplish business objectives a leader can overlook the importance of connecting with their people.  With always a new hill to climb, a new problem to solve, a leader can begin to see people as tools to use and shelve again when needed.  A wise leader will still their own rush to accomplish in order to pause and connect with the person they're interacting with.  Besides handing out work, they reach out a hand {{< cite name=Maxwell loc="pg. 113" >}}.

## Application

Where I work, I know some people better than others.  Some that I know the least sit right next to me.  The people outside my team that I know best are those who connect personally, not just on work matters.

When a person only asks me to do things, they become task masters, not coworkers.  It's hard to be engaged with them because they don't show any interest in my involvement but only want something done, or something off their plate.

It's hard for me to do good work as well when I'm not connecting with others.  Often my most productive days are those spent working with at least one other person.

In light of these realizations, my application is to make a connection with my coworkers a priority.  When I arrive and when I depart, I will leave time to talk about topics other than work, and I will continue to reach out to others outside my team for lunch conversations.
