There are two elemental types of content in any digital garden: fluid and stable. Gardeners will make their own distinctions about the two, but a distinction is necessary because of the differing approaches one might take with entry and upkeep. To merge these types into the same workflow invites confusion.

Fluid content is in-progress. It's unpolished, uncategorized raw material. It might comprise a bookmark to an online article, a wild thought jotted down while walking, a journal entry, or a project status update. The chief requirement of fluid content is that entry has the fewest barriers possible.

Stable content is curated. It's polished, thoughtfully organized, and interconnected. It might comprise a blog article, a quote with attribution, or an evergreen note. The chief requirement of stable content is that it satisfies its purpose (to inform, to teach, to document, etc).

A digital gardener may not publish a garden that contains both of these content types, but they must define the difference, at least for themselves.

## A Separate Greenhouse

Entering the gardening analogy, fluid content belongs in a greenhouse. It's the seed or the tender sprout that's not yet ready for public exposure.

A perfectly acceptable option to digital gardening is to greenhouse one's content elsewhere. I might keep all my fluid notes in a note-taking app that syncs data between my laptop and phone. When a note is mature enough for planting (though perhaps not fully mature), I can copy the content into my publishing system; put it in the digital garden.

This is standard process for most blogs. I appreciate how a separate greenhouse keeps thinking and publishing separate, allowing for an editorial step before content goes live. However, this introduces a publishing gate that can limit one's [learning in public](). Unless the gardener doesn't care to share, it's also likely that one will end up with multiple greenhouses from which to retrieve seeds. For example, a gardener might put idea-seeds in the Twitter greenhouse and journal entries in Facebook.

## A Local Greenhouse

Instead of storing fluid and stable content in separate greenhouses, a digital garden might manage its own greenhouse. A spur-of-the-moment idea might be published with a minimum of fuss to the same repository where polished content resides but only be displayed after the user marks it ready. WordPress achieves this concept with the idea of a drafted copy. The bold gardener may even publish fluid content as-is but mark it appropriately to distinguish greenhouse plants from their more mature cousins.

Wikis operate in this fasion by allowing users to create stubs for further development. I appreciate this approach because it prevents content from piling up behind an editorial gate. A nuanced web design might allow fluid content to sit alongside stable content for cutting-edge learning and exploration.
