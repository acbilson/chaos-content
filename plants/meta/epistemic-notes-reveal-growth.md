Of the many cool features of Maggie Appleton's {{< outref src="https://maggieappleton.com/garden" name="personal site" >}}, one of my favorite is the use of plants as epistemological indicators. I've adopted my own slightly modified version. Here's how it works:

If my content is new, it gets a 🌱 (seedling). This communicates that, not only is the content unfinished, it's also not fully conceived. It could grow into a substantial idea, I may prune the note entirely, or I may later contradict the core idea.

A 🌿 (sprout) has grown beyond initial formation and may even appear fully developed, but it has not gone through a quality control process. Sometimes I may leave a note at this level because my mind is not fully convinced.

A 🪴  (plant) is, for the most part, finished. Like any of my writing, it may no longer reflect my evolving perspective or take into account changes in the environment, but new growth takes precedent over perfect plants.

A 🌲  (evergreen) is finished. Unless my perspective changed dramatically, these will remain as-is for the forseeable future. They represent the end-of-the-line for a subject, at least for now :).

I'm playing fast and loose with these concepts because it's new to me and because it's for my own needs first. These icons help me tend my garden by indicating where more writing and thought is needed and let me filter out what's "finished". If you find a note that does not appear to be accurately marked, blame the editor 😉.
