In distress that I might have lost this recipe trifecta I'm publishing our apple pie recipe. It's the loving combination of many recipes over the years, all combined into one incredible, deep-dish masterpiece. It's my birthday pie.

# Deep Dish Apple Pie

This recipe is a combination of three recipes. The pie crust is from Hoosier Mama in Evanston, IL, the crumb topping source has been lost to posterity, and the filling instructions are Amie and I's mutual invention.

# Pie Dough

## Ingredients

- 1 3/4 sticks unsalted butter, divided
- 1 Tbsp       red wine vinegar
- 1/2 cup      cold water
- 2 1/4 cups   all-purpose flour
- 2 1/4 Tsp    kosher salt
- 1/2 Tbsp     granulated sugar

## Instructions

1. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch (13 mm) cubes. Freeze 5 tablespoons (70g) for 20 minutes or overnight; chill the
   remaining 1 1/2 sticks in the refrigerator until ready to use.
2. Stir the red wine vinegar into the cold water and set aside.
3. Combine the flour, salt, and sugar in the bowl of a food processor and pulse 5 or 6 times to combine.
4. Add the chilled butter and mix for 25 to 30 seconds, until the mixture resemble course meal.
5. Add the frozen butter and pulse 15 to 20 times, until the butter is in pea-sized pieces.
6. Add 6 tablespoons of the vinegar water and pulse 6 times. The dough should start to look crumbly. Test the dough by
   squeezing a small amount in the palm of your hand. If it easily holds together, it is done. If not, add 1/2
   tablespoon of the vinegar water and pulse 3 more times. Repeat the process as needed until the dough holds together.
7. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead together until smooth; dough should never come
   together in the food processor.
8. Divide the dough into 2 equal parts and roll each into a ball. Flatten the balls slightly and wrap separately in
   plastic wrap. Let the dough rest in the refrigerator until ready to use, at least 20 minutes but preferably
   overnight.

# Crumb Topping

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup             brown sugar

- 3/4 tsp             salt
- 6 Tbsp              unsalted butter, softened

## Instructions

1. Mix together sugar, flour (except the 3 Tbsp), cinnamon and salt.
2. Add butter and chill in bowl for 30 minutes.
3. Mix the final 3 Tbsp of flour into the bowl.

# Apple filling
