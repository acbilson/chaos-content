With the arrival of our second child, Amie and I began to consider whether Christmas is still the best time to visit family. Four plane tickets, crowded airports, and weather delays were a few reasons why summertime was beginning to be a more attractive option. So we purchased a cross-country-travel-friendly vehicle, packed up our bags and kids, and headed to South Dakota at the end of June.

# The Drive To Rapid City

We spaced the 16-hour drive from Evanston, IL to Rapid City, SD over three days in hopes of surviving our children. It was a stunning success, not least because of our friend's prayers and daily extended playtimes.

## Sparta, WI

Our first stop was in Sparta, WI. Why Sparta? We couldn't get a hotel room in La Crosse because they were all booked for college graduation. The boys enjoyed a morning swim at the hotel pool, then we set off for Rochester, MN. On the way we picked up coffee at {{< outref src="http://www.mymokacoffee.com/" name="Moka" >}} - so good.

## Rochester, MN

We arrived in Rochester before afternoon naps, so we stopped to get food and let the boys run. Amie discovered an incredible playzone called {{< outref src="http://www.sparkrochestermn.org/" name="Spark" >}}. Royal squealed with delight the entire time and Graham was _dedicated_ to the water table. They both slept like rocks over naptime.

## Green Earth, MN

We stopped briefly in Green Earth to refuel and stretch out legs. Home of the Jolly Green Giant!

## Sioux Falls, SD

Our second night was spent at a hotel in Sioux Falls.

## De Smet, SD

The second leg of the trip had gone so well that we decided a trip to De Smet to visit the Wilder Homestead was reasonable. It was sobering to consider the risks that Pa and Ma took to lead their family into the West to start a home on the prairie. It makes my own fears about moving seem insignificant by comparison.

We saw Laura Clark, a long-time friend of Amie's, along with her husband Tim and two boys Weston and Wilder.

Graham rode his first horse! Okay, technically it was a small pony, but to him it was a HUGE horse!

## Chamberlain, SD

With three hours left, everyone was itching to finish the journey. But we couldn't pass the Dignity statue without a brief stop. What a powerful memorial to the endurance of human image-bearers.

# Our Time in Rapid

With two energetic boys a vacation doesn't allow much time to sit around. We were out doing things with the kids pretty much every day. Here are the highlights (or at least those I have pictures of).

## Storybook Island

We met friends and family at Storybook Island the day after we arrived in Rapid. Royal stuck close to the snack wagon and I took Graham about the park. He'd get excited about a boat or a helicopter, get into it, then disappointedly say, "it no move." So we rode the train.

## Palmer's Gultch

I was skeptical about camping, but Amie was certain that we'd enjoy a couple days at a campsite called Palmer's Gultch. She was right!

## 1880 Train

## Hill City

After Amie, Graham and I rode the 1880 train we met back up with Grandma and Royal to wade in the nearby creek.

## Sylvan Lake

We spent two afternoons at Sylvan Lake. The first was with Graham and Royal; the second was just Amie and I. Graham and Royal didn't want to go hiking so we spent the whole time at the beach. So thankful Amie and I got to hike around the lake later on!

## Rapid City Parks

We visited three parks with the boys that were really fun. Here are a few photos.

## Grandma's House

Royal was so happy to meet Zibby, but he'd run whenever the dog got close. Maybe he didn't like the wet kisses?

# The Drive Back to Evanston

The day before our trip home the check engine light came on. We called five different auto mechanics, but no one could get us in until the day we left; most couldn't get us in until next week! I sent an emergency prayer request, then called the Toyota dealership back. Miraculously, I scheduled a 1:00 p.m. appointment!

We left early after picking up breakfast at Black Hills Bagels.

As we approached Wall, SD, about 60 miles from Rapid City, the check engine light returned. We visited a mechanic in Wall, called Toyota, and turned around.

And, my favorite sign.
