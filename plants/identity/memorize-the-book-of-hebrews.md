Below is a ChatGPT prompt response to help with my memorization (with a little formatting). I was five prompts deep into training ChatGPT (Mar 14) to help me scaffold my memorization of the book of Hebrews. It explained space repetition and mind palaces fairly accurately, but it wasn't personally helpful until I started asking for examples. For creative exploration, it's great. I needed the motivation to tackle this project, and applying ChatGPT is helping to keep me going.
