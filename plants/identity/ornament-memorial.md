This is a family memorial represented in the ornaments adorning our Christmas tree.

{{< caption caption="This ornament is a gift from Bronson Weston and Alexis Hruby. The Spirit enriched our lives in first year of the coronavirus pandemic with their fellowship and the joy of introducing them to Mark's gospel about Jesus.

{{< caption caption="We capped Amie's gratuation from Trinity Evangelical Divinity with a trip to Prince Edward Island.
