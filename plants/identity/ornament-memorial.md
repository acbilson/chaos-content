This is a family memorial represented in the ornaments adorning our Christmas tree.

{{< caption caption="This ornament is a gift from Bronson Weston and Alexis Hruby. The Spirit enriched our lives in first year of the coronavirus pandemic with their fellowship and the joy of introducing them to Mark's gospel about Jesus. My heart overflows with gratitude every time I remember them for the joy of their obedience to our Lord and faithful God." src="https://images.alexbilson.dev/20211204_130345.webp" >}}

{{< caption caption="This globe is marked with every place outside the U.S. that Amie or I have visited. How formative those trips have been to our sense of calling and how alive with adventure. May the glory of Jesus fill the earth!" src="https://images.alexbilson.dev/20211204_130428.webp" >}}

{{< caption caption="We capped Amie's gratuation from Trinity Evangelical Divinity with a trip to Prince Edward Island. We're so proud of Amie's achievement and even more that her friendly, fiesty spirit shapes the lives of her friends far and wide. It is the greatest privilege to be known as her friend. She is our modern-day Anne (or should I say, Cordelia?)" src="https://images.alexbilson.dev/20211204_130505.webp" >}}

{{< caption caption="The first solo trip Amie's taken since Graham was to visit her best friends Laura and Olivia Doo in Maine." src="https://images.alexbilson.dev/20211204_130530.webp" >}}

{{< caption caption="This gorgeous ornament reminds Amie of her grandmother Vallette, the matriarch of her family for generations. Her tenacity and mercy lives on in the lives of her great-grandchildren. Royal's middle name, Abiah, was chosen from her husband's lineage; one Abiah Mott Vallette born on April 6th, 1758, mother of Jonathan Gillette Vallette the surveyor." src="https://images.alexbilson.dev/20211204_130922.webp" >}}
