To hike the Colorado Trail, 486 miles across the entire Rocky Mountain range, has been my aspiration from childhood. I vividly remember as a child daydreaming on our drives along I-70 of crossing the entire Rockies with nothing more than a pack mule.

But I'm out of shape. Badly. So maybe let's aim for a more achievable goal first? The Centennial Trail, a 124 mile trip through the Black Hills of South Dakota.
