TODO: Refer to hosting friends over the weekend. Talk about how covid affects meaning.

I wonder what I might learn from Linus' [thinking about communities](https://thesephist.com/posts/community-possibility/)? Much of what he explores fits with my present quandry in finding a place, not only to write, but also to engage others. It's not that I want to build a community per se, but I _do_ want to interact with others via some means other than Twitter and Facebook. How?

For more consideration, {{< backref src="/plants/culture/tools-for-building-community" >}}.
