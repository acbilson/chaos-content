Much of what is true has its echo in many cultures. It's been an ageless wonder that, despite the struggles to identify the origins of various people groups, nearly every one shares a story of a devastating flood (e.g. Noah's flood).

The subject of spirit in other cultures is one which I am wholly ignorant. Thankfully, Dr. Yang Jwing-Ming has helpfully connected words across a few major cultures.

You should understand that this natural Qi has not only been studied by the Chinese spiritual Qigong practitioners but also by other human cultures. For example, this natural energy is called “prana” in India, “pneuma” in Greece, and “Ki” in Japan. Today, it is commonly called “cosmic energy,” “orgone energy,” or simply “natural energy or force.”
