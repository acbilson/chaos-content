Linus Lee laments that tools aren't built to assist community leaders in the formation of lively communities and suggests that we have a long ways to go. Here are a few tools I've found that might help.

I think there’s a wide-open space for us to build much, much better tools for community leaders. A community leader’s most important job is to be the model community member and contributor – all other concerns should fade into the background of their work, and we are far from it today. Community tools should have the best practices and know-hows of good community management baked into its design, and it should work across platforms and across the online-offline barrier, because great communities flourish across platforms and the online-offline barrier.
