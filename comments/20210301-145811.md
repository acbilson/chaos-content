My conviction about the relationship between Kingdom communities deepens every Sunday. Sunday gatherings are weak replacements for discipleship groups and poor avenues for individual transformation. Sunday gatherings, if their focus shifted from individuals to leaders and members of discipleship groups, would become powerful influences on the Kingdom community.
