[Privacy.com](https://privacy.com) is a service I may consider. Amie purchases items on various sites who then store our card information forever. It's creepy to have a purchase on an infrequently used website go through without account info because they have it from a year ago. This service would let me supply a dummy account that I could control for access and spending limits.
