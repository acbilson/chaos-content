Victoria’s [post](https://victoria.dev/blog/three-rules-for-choosing-a-vpn-that-takes-your-privacy-seriously/) reminds me that it’s about time I figured out how to set up a VPN. While I’m sure ExpressVPN is excellent, I’ll learn tons more by configuring my own WireGuard VPN server. It already comes with client support!
