<article class="poem flow-s">
<p>This is no time for a child to be born,</p>
<p>With the earth betrayed by war & hate</p>
<p>And a comet slashing the sky to warn</p>
<p>That time runs out & the sun burns late.</p>

<p>That was no time for a child to be born,</p>
<p>In a land in the crushing grip of Rome;</p>
<p>Honour & truth were trampled by scorn-</p>
<p>Yet here did the Saviour make his home.</p>

<p>When is the time for love to be born?</p>
<p>The inn is full on the planet earth,</p>
<p>And by a comet the sky is torn-</p>
<p>Yet Love still takes the risk of birth.</p>
