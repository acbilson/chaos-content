[At a leadership gathering] we want to see four or more generations of leaders present, or we have failed. So, we say to leaders we work with, "Tell me about the people you are mentoring, and tell me about the people your mentees are mentoring." There is always an expectation of four generations, minimum. All good leaders are intimately aware of the two generations below them and the generation above them.
