[Reynie said] "I see things differently now, and it's... bothering me, I suppose."

Mr. Benedict gazed at Reynie, stroking a bristly patch on his chin that he'd missed with his razor. He exhaled through his lumpy nose. "Since your mission, you mean?"

Reynie nodded.

"You mean to say," said Mr. Benedict after reflecting a moment, "That you're disturbed by the wickedness of which so many people seem capable. My brother, for example, but also his Executives, his henchmen, the other students at the Institute–"

"Everybody," Reynie said.

"Everybody?"

"Or... or almost everybody. I certainly don't think that about you–or about any of us who've come together because of you. And there's Miss Perumal and her mother, of course, and a few other people. In general, though..." Reynie shrugged. "I thought with the Whisperer out of commission–with Mr. Curtain's hidden messages no longer affecting people's minds–well, I thought things would start to seem different. Better. But that hasn't happened."

"You aren't doubting what you accomplished, I hope."

Reynie shook his head. "No, I know we stopped terrible things from happening. It's just that I hadn't expected to start seeing things–to see people–this way."

Mr. Benedict made as if to rise, then thought better of it. "An old habit," he said. "I occasionally feel an urge to pace, which, as you know, is ill-advised. If I dropped off and brained myself against the bookcase, Number Two would never let me hear the end of it."

Reynie chuckled. He was well aware of Number Two's fearsome protectiveness.

Mr. Benedict settled back against his desk. "It's natural that you feel as you do, Reynie. There is much more to the world than most children–indeed, most adults–ever see or know. And where most people see mirrors, you, my friend, see windows. By which I mean there is always something beyond the glass. You have seen it and will always see it now, though others may not. I would have spared you that vision at such a young age. But it's been given you, and it will be up to you to decide whether it's a blessing or a curse."

"Excuse me, Mr. Benedict, but how can it possibly be a blessing to know that people are untrustworthy?"

Mr. Benedict looked at Reynie askance. "Rather than answer that, allow me to call attention to the assumption you're making–the assumption that most people are untrustworthy. Have you considered the possibility, Reynie, that wickedness is simply more noticeable than goodness? That wickedness _stands out_, as it were?"

When Reynie looked doubtful, Mr. Benedict nodded and said, "I wouldn't expect you to change your mind so quickly. You're used to being right about people–we all know you have marvelous intuition–and it's difficult for you to question the conclusions you've drawn. But as I do with my pacing, Reynie, you must guard against old habits leading you astray." Mr. Benedict crossed his arms and regarded Reynie shrewdly. "Let me ask you: Have you ever had a dream in which, having spied a deadly snake at your feet, you suddenly begin to see snakes everywhere–suddenly realize, in fact, that you're surrounded by them?"

Reynie was surprised. "I _have_ had that dream. It's a nightmare."

"Indeed. And it strikes me as being rather like when a person first realizes the extent of wickedness in the world. That vision can become all-consuming–and in a way, it too, is a nightmare, by which I mean that it is not quite a proper assessment of the state of things. For someone as observant as you, Reynie, deadly serpents always catch the eye. But if you find that serpents are _all_ you see, you may not be looking hard enough."
