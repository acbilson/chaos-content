I said, "There are no flowers there."
He said, "No flowers, but a crown."

I said, "But the skies are black,
There is nothing but noise and din."
And he wept as he sent me back;
"There is more," he said, "there is sin."

and fogs are veiling the sun."

And souls in the dark undone."

And friends will miss me, they say."
He answered, "Choose tonight

Then set my face to the town.
He said, "My child, do you yield?
Will you leave the flowers for the crown?"

And into my heart came He;
And I walk in a light divine,
The path I had feared to see.
