William Deresiewicz writes: "Having recently moved across the country, I thought that Facebook would help me feel more connected to the friends I'd left behind. But now I find the opposite is true. Reading about the mundane details of their lives, a steady stream of trivia and ephemera, leaves me feeling both empty and unpleasantly full, as if I had just binged on junk food, and precisely because it reminds me of the real sustenance, the real knowledge, we exchange by email or phone or face-to-face."
