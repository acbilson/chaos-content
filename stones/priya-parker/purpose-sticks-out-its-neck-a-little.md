Most purposes for gatherings feel worthy and respectable but are also basic and bland: "We're hosting a welcome dinner so that our new colleague feels comfortable in our tight-knit group," or "I'm throwing a birthday party to look back on the year." These are purposes, but they fail at the test for a meaningful reason for coming together: Does it stick its neck out a little bit? Does it take a stand? Is it willing to unsettle some of the guests (or maybe the host)? Does it refuse to be everything to everyone?
