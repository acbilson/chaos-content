I am the true grapevine. My Father is the Vine Keeper. He cuts off the branches in me that have no fruit. He carefully trims back the branches with fruit, so they will grow more fruit.

My teachings have purified you, but you must stay joined to me in the same way a branch is joined to the vine. A branch cannot grow fruit unless it is joined to the vine. It is the same with you and me.

I am the vine and you are the branches. The ones who stay joined to me will grow much fruit, for without me nothing grows. The ones who do not stay joined to me are broken off and dry up, and then they are gathered up and used to make a fire.

If you are joined to me and my words remain in you, you can ask me for anything and it will be done. When you grow a harvest of fruit, this will show that you are walking my road. You will then bring great honor to my Father.
