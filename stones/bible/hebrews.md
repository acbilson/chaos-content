Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.

He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power.

After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high[1], having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.

For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son, today I have begotten you"?

Or again, "I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son"?

And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all God's angels worship him[2]"

Of the angels he says, "He makes his angels winds, and his ministers a flame of fire."

But of the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated wickeness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions."

1. Deuteronomy 32:3 has the same unique phrase "Majesty" μεγαλωσύνη in the Septuagint. TODO: Look also for sitting down at the right hand.
1. Deuteronomy 32:43 has the same unique phrase "worship him" προσκυνέω in the Septuagint. The version of the OT text seems to matter here. This section of Hebrews is tightly connected to Moses' song in Deuteronomy 32.
