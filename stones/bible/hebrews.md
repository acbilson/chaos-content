Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.

He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe[1] by the word of his power[2].

After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty[3] on high, having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.

For to which of the angels did God ever say,

{{< poetry >}}
You are my Son,
today I have begotten you[4]
{{< /poetry >}}

Or again,

{{< poetry >}}
I will be to him a father,
and he shall be to me a son[5]
{{< /poetry >}}

And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says,

{{< poetry >}}
Let all God's angels worship him[6]
{{< /poetry >}}

Of the angels he says,

{{< poetry >}}
He makes his angels winds,
and his ministers a flame of fire[7]
{{< /poetry >}}

But of the Son he says,

{{< poetry >}}
Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,
the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.
You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;
therefore God, your God, has anointed you
with the oil of gladness beyond your companions[8]
{{< /poetry >}}

And,

{{< poetry >}}
You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning,
and the heavens are the work of your hands;
they will perish, but you remain;
they will wear out like a garment,
like a robe you will roll them up,
like a garment they will be changed.
But you are the same,
and your years will have no end[9]
{{< /poetry >}}

And to which of the angels has he ever said,

{{< poetry >}}
Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet[10]
{{< /poetry >}}

Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?

Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it.[11]

For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?

It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard, while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.

For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking[12]. It has been testified somewhere,

{{< poetry >}}
What is man, that you are mindful of him,
or the son of man, that you care for him?
You made him for a little while lower than the angels;
you have crowned him with glory and honor,
putting everything in subjection under his feet.[13]
{{< /poetry >}}

Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control.

At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.

But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.

For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering.

For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source.

That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers, saying,

{{< poetry >}}
I will tell of your name to my brothers;
in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise.[14]
{{< /poetry >}}

And again,

{{< poetry >}}
I will put my trust in him.[15]
{{< /poetry >}}

And again,

{{< poetry >}}
Behold, I and the children God has given me.[16]
{{< /poetry >}}

Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.

For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham.

Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.

For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.

Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession, who was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house.

For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses–as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.

(For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.)

Now Moses was faithful in all God's house[17] as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later, but Christ is faithful over God's house as a son.

And we are his house, if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope.

Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,

{{< poetry >}}
Today, if you hear his voice,
do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,
on the day of testing in the wilderness,
where your fathers put me to the test
and saw my works for forty years.
Therefore I was provoked with that generation,
and said, "They always go astray in their heart;
they have not known my ways."
As I swore in my wrath,
"They shall not enter my rest."[18]
{{< /poetry >}}

Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God.

But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called "today", that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.

For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end.

As it is said,

{{< poetry >}}
Today, if you hear his voice,
do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.
{{< /poetry >}}

For who were those who heard and rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses?

And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?

And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient?

So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.

Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it.

For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened[19].

For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said,

{{< poetry >}}
As I swore in my wrath,
"They shall not enter my rest,"
{{< /poetry >}}

although his works were finished from the foundation of the world.

For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: "And God rested on the seventh day from all his works."

And again in this passage he said,

{{< poetry >}}
"They shall not enter my rest."
{{< /poetry >}}

Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience, again he appoints a certain day, "Today," saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted,

{{< poetry >}}
Today, if you hear his voice,
do not harden your hearts.
{{< /poetry >}}

For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken of another day later on.

So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God, for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his.

Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.

For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.

And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.

## Ongoing Notes & Discoveries

1. The ESV translates πάντα as universe, but it is commonly translated "all". Thus not an allusion to the voice of God, his "one speech", as I had supposed.
2. This strange phrase, "upholds the universe by the word of his power" may be an allusion to Psalm 75:3 "When the earth totters, and all its inhabitants, it is I who keep steady its pillars. Selah".
3. Deuteronomy 32:3 has the same unique noun "Majesty" μεγαλωσύνη in the Septuagint.
4. A quotation from Psalm 2:7. Also quoted by Paul in his early speech on Cyprus (Acts 13:33).
5. Refers to multiple Davidic statements (2Sa 7:14; 1Ch 17:13; 1Ch 22:10). Possibly also a reference to Ps 89:27 "And I will make him the firstborn,
the highest of the kings of the earth" especially given the author's use of firstborn in the next sentence.
6. Deuteronomy 32:43 has the same unique phrase "worship him" προσκυνέω in the Septuagint. The version of the OT text seems to matter here. This section of Hebrews is tightly connected to Moses' song in Deuteronomy 32.
7. A direct quote of Psalm 104:4.
8. A direct quote of Psalm 45:6-7.
9. A direct quote of Psalm 102:25-27.
10. A direct quote of Psalm 110:1.
11. This is deeply unsettling when I consider how poorly the original hearers of the Torah responded, and they to a visible presence on Mount Sinai! I suspect that the unstated problem behind this warning is that the Jewish readers of this letter were tempted to discount Jesus' person and words as only that of a prophet or teacher (or angel?). If so, it may be similar to Jesus' rebuke in John 8:37 that, even though his listeners are descendants of Abraham, they prove themselves false by their treatment of him. This doesn't limit the sufficiency of the Hebrew scriptures for true faith; see Jesus' parable of the rich man and Lazarus, where the Torah and Prophets are implicitly sufficient.
12. alluding back to the Psalm 102:25-27 quote.
13. A direct quote of Psalm 8:4-6.
14. A direct quote of Psalm 22:22.
15. Could be one of many references. Gotta look for one that makes sense with the brother/children reference.
16. A direct quote of Isaiah 8:18.
17. A reference to Numbers 12:7 "Not so with my servant Moses. He is faithful in all my house."
18. A direct quote of Psalm 95:7-11.
19. The singular verb, συγκεκραμένος (united, as in water mixed with wine) is a variant with less support than its plural form συγκεκραμένους. This is significant, since the object of the verb switches from faith (singlular) to the listeners (plural). The BDAG supplies an alternative translation with this plural form, "the word that they heard did not benefit those who were not united with those who listened in faith." However, the meaning is not clear to me either way; of faith mixing with listening obedience (that doesn't make sense) or the faithless not mixing with those who in listening obedience reveal their faith (better, but mixing with others like water with wine is a strange analogy. Not unprecedented in modern language, but is this an ancient near-East saying?)
