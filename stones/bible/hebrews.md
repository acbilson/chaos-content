Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.

He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power[1].

After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high[2], having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.

For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son, today I have begotten you[3]"?

Or again, "I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son[4]"?

And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all God's angels worship him[5]"

Of the angels he says, "He makes his angels winds, and his ministers a flame of fire."

But of the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated wickeness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions."

And, "You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of your hands; they will perish, but you remain; they will wear out like a garment, like a robe you will roll them up, like a garment they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will have no end."

And to which of the angels has he ever said, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet?[6]"

Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?

Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it.

For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution, how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?

It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard, while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.

1. This strange phrase, "upholds the universe by the word of his power" may be an allusion to Psalm 75:3 "When the earth totters, and all its inhabitants, it is I who keep steady its pillars. Selah". The ESV translates πάντα as universe, but it is commonly translated "all". Thus not an allusion to the voice of God, his "one speech", as I had supposed.
2. Deuteronomy 32:3 has the same unique phrase "Majesty" μεγαλωσύνη in the Septuagint.
3. A quotation from Psalm 2:7. Also quoted by Paul in his early speech on Cyprus (Acts 13:33).
4. Refers to multiple Davidic statements (2Sa 7:14; 1Ch 17:13; 1Ch 22:10). Possibly also a reference to Ps 89:27 "And I will make him the firstborn,
the highest of the kings of the earth" especially given the author's use of firstborn in the next sentence.
5. Deuteronomy 32:43 has the same unique phrase "worship him" προσκυνέω in the Septuagint. The version of the OT text seems to matter here. This section of Hebrews is tightly connected to Moses' song in Deuteronomy 32.
6. A direct quote of Psalm 110:1.
