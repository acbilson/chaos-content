<div class="poem">
<p>Master, they say that when I seem</p>
<p>To be in speech with you,</p>
<p>Since you make no replies, it's all a dream</p>
<p>––One talker aping two.<br /><br /></p>

<p>They are half right, but not as they</p>
<p>Imagine; rather, I</p>
<p>Seek in myself the things I meant to say,</p>
<p>And lo! the wells are dry.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Then, seeing me empty, you forsake</p>
<p>The Listener's role, and through</p>
<p>My dead lips breathe and into utterance wake</p>
<p>The thoughts I never knew.<br /><br /></p>

<p>And thus you neither need reply</p>
<p>Nor can; thus, while we seem</p>
<p>Two talking, though art One forever, and I</p>
<p>No dreamer, but thy dream.</p>
