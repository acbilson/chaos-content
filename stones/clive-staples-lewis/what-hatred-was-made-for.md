Then an experience that perhaps no good man can ever have in our world came over himâ€“a torrent of perfectly unmixed and lawful hatred. The energy of hating, never before felt without some guilt, without some dim knowledge that he was failing fully to distinguish the sinner from the sin, rose into his arms and legs till he felt that they were pillars of burning blood. What was before him appeared no longer a creature of corrupted will. It was corruption itself to which will was attached only as an instrument. Ages ago it had been a person: but the ruins of personality now survived in it only as weapons at the disposal of a furious self-exiled negation. It is perhaps difficult to understand why this filled Ransom not with horror but with a kind of joy. The joy came from finding at last what hatred was for. As a boy with an ax rejoices on finding a tree, or a boy with a box of colored chalks rejoices in finding a pile of perfectly white paper, so he rejoiced in the perfect congruity between his emotion and its object.
