Whatever you do, don’t take the shortcut of only looking at how Christians act. Doing so is lazy because every Christian falls short of the teachings of Christ, and the majority of them aren’t actually familiar with what the Bible says. Too many use the Bible as a self-help book that they read whenever they need a pick-me-up, while others use it mainly as a tool to manipulate others or make more money.

If you doubt the influence of Christianity on your life, remember that it’s so foundational that it even frames our perspective on time and space. We calculate the year by counting how many times the earth has rotated around the sun since the birth of Christ. When we talk about geography, we reference “East and West” in relation to Christ’s birthplace.

Ignoring the Bible is one of the biggest mistakes that smart people make — and they’re proud to make it too.
