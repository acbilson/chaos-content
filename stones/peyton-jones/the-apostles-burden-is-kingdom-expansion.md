One might think that the apostle is burdened for the lost, but that's only a part of it. Apostles are dominated by a burden for the expansion of the kingdom of God and are passionate to see the glory of God cover the earth like the seas. The first order of business, therefore, is kingdom expansionâ€“not just geographically, but crossing societal frontiers into marginalized groups where Christ is not named.
