If I were to go back, I would tell that young man that he was apostolic; before it was cool. Because, I didn't understand I had a lifecycle in a place. It still to this day doesn't matter. You put me in a position, you give me a job, you pay me a bunch of money, you give me an executive card, and I've been there in different roles. I don't stay.

It's the apostolic. You commit career suicide time after time after time. I remember at one point going, "do I have ministerial attachment issues? Do I need counseling?" But I didn't realize I was apostolic.

(in response to Josh's question, "What advice would you give your 21-year-old self?")
