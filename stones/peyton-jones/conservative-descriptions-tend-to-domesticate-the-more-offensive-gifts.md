Conservatives [i.e. Shepherds and Teachers] would rather talk about "abiding," discipleship, and community–all low-risk activities–and would rather describe the work of evangelists as simply being excellent neighbors who throw good barbeques. This is the domesticated version of what shepherds and teachers think evangelists _should be_. In truth, evangelists cause offense with frontline preaching of the gospel in public. If your evangelists don't cause your leadership team occasional embarrassment, they are not evangelists. Remember that the Corinthians were embarrassed by Paul's evangelism as an apostle, which let to his remark, "For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you" (2 Cor 5:13 ESV).
