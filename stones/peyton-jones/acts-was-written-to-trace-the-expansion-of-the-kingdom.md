Acts wasn't written to demonstrate how to plant a church. Rather, the book of Acts was written to trace the expansion of the Kingdom: "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." (_NIV_, Acts 1:8)
