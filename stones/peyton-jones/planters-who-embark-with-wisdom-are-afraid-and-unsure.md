A failure to learn from the expertise of a builder like Paul will most likely result in building an unhealthy church to the detriment of all, including the planter. Arrogant planters (and there are many) start out with a refusal to _learn_ from anyone, convinced that they have much to _teach_. They learn in the end, but they learn the hard way. In contrast, most successful planters who embark on their first voyage with wisdom are afraid, unsure, and doubt they are up to the task. And for good reason. Of the churches planted, 68 percent don't survive past year four. Fearful learners make for a teachable audience, and Paul has much to offer such students.
