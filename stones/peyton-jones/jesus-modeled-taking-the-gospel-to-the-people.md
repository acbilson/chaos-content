Paul's methodology was to proclaim Christ in the synagogue, home, workshop, city square, hall, and even when publicly on trial. Jesus had primarily preached, too, but about himself. Jesus modeled taking the gospel to the people, rather than expecting them to come to him. Schabel points out that Jesus says that gospel proclamation must take place in palaces (Luke 7:25), marketplaces (Luke 7:32; 11:43), roads and streets (Luke 10:10; 13:26; 14:21), law courts and prisons (Luke 12:57-59; 18:2), and city gates (Luke 13:24). Jesus modeled preaching in every single one of these environments and called for his disciples to do the same.
