Planters who are sent by God are nearly impossible to stop. The only way to slow the apostle Paul was to lock him up, and the only way to stop him was to separate his head from his shoulders. Eventually, as an apostolic planter, you will wrestle with every kind of argument and excuse throughout the process of your calling; but, in the end, that call to sent-ness will defy logic, haunt you in bed at night, and keep you awake when the rest of the house is sleeping. You'll want to come out of your chestwhen you hear bad preaching or missed opportunities. Your appetite for Scripture will grow ravenous, your awareness of your need for prayer will deepen, and your compassion for the lost will be enflamed to the point of pain. When God enlists us on apostolic mission, it will take every bit of strength we have, and so he begins to change everything that we are.
