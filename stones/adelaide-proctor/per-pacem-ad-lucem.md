{{< poetry >}}
I do not ask, O Lord, that life may be
A pleasant road;
I do not ask that thou would'st take from me
Aught of this load;

I do not ask that flowers should always spring
Beneath my feet;
I know too well the poison and the sting
Of things too sweet;

For one thing only, Lord, dear Lord, I plead
Lead me aright–
Though strength should falter, and though heart should bleed–
Through peace to light.

I do not ask, O Lord, that thou should'st shed
Full radiance here;
Give but a ray of peace, that I may tread
Without a fear.

I do not ask my cross to understand.
My way to see–
Better in darkness just to feel thy hand,
And follow thee.

Joy is like restless day; but peace divine
Like quiet night:
Lead me, O Lord–till perfect day shall shine
Through peace to light.
