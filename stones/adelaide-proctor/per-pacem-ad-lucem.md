<div class="poem flow-s">
  <p>I do not ask, O Lord, that life may be</p>
  <p>A pleasant road;</p>
  <p>I do not ask that thou would'st take from me</p>
  <p>Aught of this load;</p>

  <p>I do not ask that flowers should always spring</p>
  <p>Beneath my feet;</p>
  <p>I know too well the poison and the sting</p>
  <p>Of things too sweet;</p>

  <p>For one thing only, Lord, dear Lord, I plead</p>
  <p>Lead me aright–</p>
  <p>Though strength should falter, and though heart should bleed–</p>
  <p>Through peace to light.</p>

  <p>I do not ask, O Lord, that thou should'st shed</p>
  <p>Full radiance here;</p>
  <p>Give but a ray of peace, that I may tread</p>
  <p>Without a fear.</p>

  <p>I do not ask my cross to understand.</p>
  <p>My way to see–</p>
  <p>Better in darkness just to feel thy hand,</p>
  <p>And follow thee.</p>

  <p>Joy is like restless day; but peace divine</p>
  <p>Like quiet night:</p>
  <p>Lead me, O Lord–till perfect day shall shine</p>
  <p>Through peace to light.</p>
