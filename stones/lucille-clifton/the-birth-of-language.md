{{< poetry >}}
and adam rose
fearful in the garden
without words
for the grass
his fingers plucked
without a tongue
to name the taste
shimmering in his mouth
did they draw blood
the blades  did it become
his early lunge
toward language
did his astonishment
surround him
did he shudder
did he whisper
eve
