Jesus was not _selfless_. He did not live as if _only_ other people counted. He knew his value and worth. He had friends. He asked people to help him. At the same time Jesus was not _selfish_. He did not live as if nobody else counted. He gave his life out of love for others. From a place of loving union with his Father, Jesus had a mature, healthy "true self."
