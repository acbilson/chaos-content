The forces of evil are able to work from within as well as without. There is much misunderstanding about this in the Church as well as in the world; it is widely believed and taught that through various spiritual practices one can gain access to an untainted center at the core of being. This is not orthodox Christian belief and it certainly is not Tolkien's belief; hence his emphasis on the demonic element within. The corruption at the core of Minas Tirith was so total that Sauron would have captured the city and what remained of the realm of Gondor with surpassing ease had it not been for the intervention long planned from another realm.
