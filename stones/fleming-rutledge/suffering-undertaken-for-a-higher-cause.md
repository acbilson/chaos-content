[θλῖψις](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g2347/kjv/tr/0-1/) can be translated "apocalypic suffering" because it refers to the affliction suffered by the servants of God in the ongoing conflict with the "world rulers of this present darkness" as Ephesians calls them (6:12). This is not ordinary suffering that comes willy-nilly to everyone. This is suffering that is voluntarily undertaken for the sake of a higher cause. The entire Ring saga could be described as a tale of _apocalyptic affliction_ endured so that the united _kingdom_ [[βασιλεία](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g932/kjv/tr/0-1/)] of Arnor and Gondor can be restored to its rightful ruler. This _endurance_ is called [ὑπομονή](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5281/kjv/tr/0-1/), and it is one of the central marks of the Christian life.
