## Relational Circuits Checklist (Are our RCs on or off?)

1. I just want to make a problem, person or feeling go away.
2. I don't want to listen to what others feel or say.
3. My mind is "locked onto" something upsetting.
4. I don't want to be connected to [blank]. (Someone I usually like)
5. I just want to get away, fight, or freeze. (verses Calm + Connect)
6. I more aggressively interrogate, judge and fix others.
