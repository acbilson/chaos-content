We tend to spend a lot of energy focusing on resolving traumas in the hope that we will be free from the pain trauma brings. What we often miss or overlook is the power of building memories of God's goodness that give us a sense of being loved. Noticing God's goodness and appreciating His gifts can be viewed as depositing money in our "Immanuel" savings accounts, whereas focusing on painful evens in life can be like withdrawing money! Thus, the daily practice of recognizing God's goodness is always recommended to strengthen our brains to habitually notice Immanuel in every situation including pain.
