Thought rhyming takes participants through five steps from God's perspective as God offers attunement to His children. In distress, God helps us restore our [relational circuits] and peace. Through the Immanuel journaling process, God brings healing to the broken interactions (misattunements) we experienced in life. Suppose we need to start our thought rhyming while we are feeling upset about something; we can use the following sequence.

1. I can see you
2. I can hear you
3. I can understand how hard this is for you
4. I am glad to be with you
5. I can do something about what you are going through

(steps and order borrowed from Exodus 3:7-8a)
