In Ephesians 2:10, Paul uses the Greek word _poiema_, which literally means God's poetry. When _poiema_ is translated as "handiwork" or "workmanship" it misses the following important point. Poetry in scripture does not rhyme sounds; it follows the Hebrew pattern and rhymes thoughts. This means that as God's poetry, our thoughts can rhyme with our Heavenly Father's.
