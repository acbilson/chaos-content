[Warren Buffett] tells the [pilot] to make a list of the top twenty-five things he wants out of life and then to arrange them in order, from the most important to the least. The top five, Buffett says, should be those around which he organizes his time. But contrary to what the pilot might have been expecting to hear, the remaining twenty, Buffett allegedly explains, aren't the second-tier priorities to which he should turn when he gets the chance. Far from it. In fact, they're the ones he should actively avoid at all costsâ€“because they're the ambitions insufficiently important to him to form the core of his life yet seductive enough to distract him from the ones that matter most.
