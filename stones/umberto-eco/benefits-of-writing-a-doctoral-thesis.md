Umberto Eco suggests writing a thesis will benefit a person who has completed a doctorate thesis because they will have:

1. Identified a precise topic
2. Collected documents on that topic
3. Ordered these documents
4. Reexamined the topic in light of the documents collected
5. Organized all this work into an organic form
6. Ensured that his readers have understood him
7. Provided the necessary documentation so that readers may reexamine the topic through his sources.
