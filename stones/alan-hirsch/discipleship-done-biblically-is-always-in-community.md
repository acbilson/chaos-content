I think a lot of these things rest in the issue of discipleship... Discipleship done biblically is always in community. It's never just one-on-one. I think that's a big mistake that Western individualists make. I'm sure that Jesus did one-on-one with his people, but you never get a view of it anywhere in the scriptures. It's always in groups.

(in answer this question from Josh Johnson, "Can we as people caught in the walls of the church, can we reorient ourselves into a place where we can have true, authentic community that's not just a Sunday gathering?")
