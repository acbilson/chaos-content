Caste and race are neither synonymous nor mutually exclusive. The can and do coexist in the same culture and serve to reinforce each other.

Race is what we can see, the physical traits that have been given arbitrary meaning and become shorthand for who a person is. Caste is the powerful infrastructure that holds each group in its place.
