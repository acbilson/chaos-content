Compared with the Western spiritual science and understanding, in my personal opinion, the East has developed far beyond the West. The reason for this is simply because of the involvement of politics in Western religion. Glory, dignity, power, and wealth have become the major concerns in Western religious societies. Although of course, there have been examples of the same thing in Eastern religions, this has been more of an exception. For this reason, in Europe and in the Americas, it was more common for those people who had natural inborn spiritual capabilities to be accused as witches and burned to death. In China, the situation was very different. Those spiritual people would usually hide themselves in the mountains for spiritual cultivation. Many of them would write their experiences down and these were passed down to us. In China, it was very common that when those spiritually talented people were found, they were said to have affinity for Buddhahood or the Dao. These people were usually sent to the monasteries for further training.
